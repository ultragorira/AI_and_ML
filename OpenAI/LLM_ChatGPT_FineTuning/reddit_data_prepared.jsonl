I was definitely sober, I had full control of what I was doing. So I went up to this girl same age. We knew each other before but never spoke. We were in a group just walking. She did not have any alcohol at this point. I put my arm around her waist (nowhere near her ass). And we talk for a bit. Just small talk like how we have never met, tell her my name etc. In this time she does not move away or tell me to go away or any sign of discomfort. During this time She actually puts her arm around my waist as well. I wanted to leave the group and meet some other friends so I turn to her and tell her how beautiful she was tonight and just left . That was the end of our interaction. \n\nA few days pass and I find out that she actually went around her school saying that I raped\/took advantage of her which I absolutely did not.

I'm usually pretty chill about this, but here's the thing: That aunt is a **confirmed** carrier of Corona virus, yet shes coming here and my parents are okay with it...? WTF?  \n\nAs to how exactly she's allowed to travel: she's **not.** This is Illegal and dangerous but it seems i have no say on the matter... my only hope is to avoid getting infected. I need help, what should I do with an infected person on the house?\n\n\/\/ Update #1\n\nDue to the amount of advices saying that I should report this, I really feel the need to now. I'm typing this as she's on a plane, on her way here, so avoiding that is no longer possible... \n\nI will contact the local police department, they should be here before she arrives and I'm definitely getting into trouble... But if i think really hard about it, my parents caused this, not me. It's easier that way.\n\n\/\/ Update #2\n\nSo... This escalated quickly. I called the non emergency line and told them a family member was coming to the house and they were a carrier of Corona. My city is on a lockdown since the growing cases of the last week so I expected the police to come over stay with us until aunt arrives, and they would tell us what to do. Not so...\n\nPolice arrived, took my parents for interrogation and one of them told me my aunt is being intercepted. Holy, fuck.\n\nI'm alone in my house now, it's night, and looks like they're not gonna be here til tomorrow. I think updates will stop for now but for sure I won't be seeing aunt so soon. Might have been the right thing to do but I'm definitely screwed... In a month from now I might be here on the sub again asking how do I adapt to a new home, I'm 20 and I have a day job so my chances of getting kicked out after this are really high :(\n\nThank you for all the advice. No doubt, it was the best course of action.\n\n\/\/ Post storm update #3\n\nAunt is being kept at the hospital, she indeed has the virus, and i don't know yet if shes gonna be fined for the trip or not, but I imagine she will : \/ \n\nFor those asking, she's not here to just visit, she came *because* of the symptoms. She wanted family contact cause she feared not having another chance (an over reaction, i know).\n\nI haven't been kicked out, but parents are not talking to me. To those sending lovely messages saying I should already have my own house: I'm not rich, I pay for my own food and transport and the only things I get from this house are the roof and people to talk to during breakfast as I work during the day and study at night. I don't hate my parents, they're good people, just clueless when it comes to common sense sometimes.\n\nSo that's it, crisis averted. I'm not getting infected by this god awful virus and aunt should be ok in a week, back to her home to pay the debts. I'll try cooking some nice things and bringing some god news to the table more frequently so my parents forget about this episode, but thanks for all the support in the majority of the comments, good to know this went a lot smoother than hiding in my own house.

I declined, freaked out and am now leaving. My concern is for my sisters. \n\n\nMy aunt did what she said she was going to do, she barged in with 3 other people, one of them a social worker friend of hers (who was off duty) and my uncle. None of them are allowed at the house so as soon as Scott found out they were there, he called the police.  \n\nBefore the police even showed up, I told my 16 year old sister and the 14 year olds what happened. The 16 year old got angry at her dad. She was walking around the house ranting at her dad and crying. Eventually she decided to come with my aunt and I and then we would firgure out where she could go from then on. However the two 14 year olds did not believe me, they actually started laughing. Then they got angry and told me I was “trying to destroy” our family and “how could you make up a sick lie”. It got to the point where they threw my and my 16 year sisters stuff out the window. By that time the cops came and told my aunt, uncle and the social worker they had to leave the property. \n\nThe social worker friend let the cops know everything thats been going on. The cops didn’t care, they just cared about the noise and the trespassers. So I, my 16 year old sister, my aunt and uncle and their friend left. Very soon after my grandparents came and got the other three girls, after the 14 year olds called them and came to there senses.\n\nI found out my my grandma that one of the 14 year olds confronted her dad and he didn’t deny anything. In fact he called me a whore and said I should’ve had any problems doing what he asked. That’s when they packed a bag and called my grandparents.My grandparents explained everything separately to the little one. She told my grandpa she prefers him to our dad because grandpa doesn’t yell at her. As much as that pained me, I hope it’s enough to keep the girls at my grandparents for good. \n\nMy 16 year old sister is going to emancipate herself and stay with either our grandparents or our aunt. CPS was called but it was my grandparents this time. I have multiple screen shots on my and my aunts phone of my mother incriminating herself, so we will be able to file charges and hopefully get Scott on the SO registry. That way the girls can stay at their grandparents permanently. \n\nThank you all for the support I appreciate each and every one of your comments, and to the survivors who shared their stories, you are all so strong, thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Good job!

{"prompt":"[Update] \n\nYesterday was suppose to be one of the most happiest days of my life and it turned out to be the worst. My fiancé never showed up to the ceremony leaving me at the altar. His friends and family tried to get a hold of him but all calls went straight to voice-mail. After waiting an hour for him I told my guests that there wasn't going to be a wedding. I opened the reception hall and told them to enjoy the food and open bar, even if there was no ceremony, I still wanted them to have a good time and enjoy the food and drinks. I tried to call him a couple of times but after 3 more failed calls I just stopped and told everyone else who were trying to get a hold of him to stop. He made it clear he didn't want anyone to get a hold of him and I wasn't going to have them waste their time.\n\n\nI didn't cry, I wasn't going to cry. At least not in front of everyone. His mother came to me and apologized through tears, she told me how disappointed she was in him and that she was so sorry. I just shook my head and stuck with her the entire time. I didn't want her to cry and feel bad for something that wasn't her fault.\n\n\nThe real MVPs were all my friends. They did their absolute best to keep things from being awkward and entertained everyone. They played music, danced and one of them went as far as going back home to bring a projector and a game system for all the kids and teens to play against each other with. I was glad that the day was somewhat saved but I still felt horrible. My would-be BIL Ethan kept me from getting shit faced when I really wanted to, told me that it would be awkward if I did so I did my best to keep everyone happy.\n\n\nAfter 11 I told everyone who bought gifts to take them back and get their money back, a few of them refused and had me keep the gifts they got. So now I'm back at the hotel we got and I'm alone. This morning I got a couple of missed calls from my fiancé and several messages that I haven't opened yet. I'm so angry at him, he humiliated me yesterday by not showing up when he could've told me he was getting cold feet. I had my friend message him that I want to be left alone and that if he showed up to the hotel room I was going to call my brothers to have him removed. So far he hasn't shown up but I am getting phone calls from his friends probably all wanting me to speak to him. I don't know if it's me being shallow or not but now I'm rethinking our entire relationship and whether or not I see a future with him. \n\n\nSo another issue is that I have an extra plane ticket. It was supposed to be for our honeymoon but since the fiancé isn't here I decided to enjoy my little getaway vacation for myself. A couple of friends are coming with me but not for another week since they gotta get childcare, put vacation time etc so they can't come since it last second. To be honest I want to invite Ethan because I've never traveled anywhere in my life. I know he's been to where I'm going and I want him to come so he can be there to show us the places to be at. Ethan told me he'd go for me but should I invite him? I asked Ethan's mom and she was all for it but I still don't know if it'll cause drama. Any advice? \n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nOkay so I feel like I should explain more about Ethan. First I'm not going to take him. Second, I've known Ethan a little longer than my ex-fiancé.  Please believe me when I say he's a close friend of mine, both of us bonded by teasing his brother and with that we just kinda clicked and became fast friends. I wanted to take him because I didn't know how to use my ticket in the airport. I've never been traveling and I didn't want to look dumb by trying to figure it out. Thankfully, someone said what to do and I'm forever grateful so now I feel much more confident. I know it sounded iffy trying to take Ethan but honestly it was for something innocent. I see him more of a brother then anything now that I look at all the comments you guys left.\n\nAnd finally I read my ex-fiance's messages. Yes, he's alive, he wasn't in any terrible accident and the reason he never showed up was because he found out he has a kid. His childhood sweet heart came by with a kid maybe a couple of weeks ago. His best man knew and never told me because my ex didn't want him to tell me until he was 100% percent sure and I guess he found out today. He apologized so many times for not showing up but he couldn't because he felt so guilty of what? I don't know. He said a large part of him wants to make things right and take care of his son because he's always wanted a family. So screw the last 3 years right? I don't know if that means he's going to go back to his ex because he wants to talk over the phone. Honestly, I'm done. I think it's an excuse to get back with his ex, I don't believe he's ever gotten over her and her over him which is why she chose now to show herself. He sent a picture of the kid to me and I went over ex-fiance's mom's fb to see any pictures she posted of ex-fiance when he was a kid. They're low quality but there is definitely a resemblance. It feels so surreal to me, like this one big joke. I feel like I'm missing more info, like there's something else going on but I'll find out later. I haven't responded so instead I'm just going to open a bottle of wine and just get plastered. My best friend is currently on her way with takeout and ice cream so I thought I'd share this.\n\nMaybe after my much needed vacation I'll do another update but right now I'm just gonna do me. \n\nUntil then, fuck you Ben\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \n>now I'm rethinking our entire relationship and whether or not I see a future with him\n\nHe literally left you standing at the altar.

This situation has turned dark and I will be making a final update in a few hours before I delete this account.\n\nMy mom and dad divorced when I was 5 years old, and my mom has been completely out of the picture ever since. My dad starting dating my now stepmom when I was 9, they got married right after I turned 10, and she immediately moved in with us. Obviously, since I didn't even know my mom, I quickly grew attached to her and she took me right under her wing. My dad couldn't have married a better woman, and she treated him right. I don't think I've ever seen her yell or get angry a single time in the entire 9 years that I've known her. Her and I have a great mother-son relationship, and I often went to her for private advice on things before I even considered going to my dad. \n\nNow, in the last few months, my dad has been acting sort of distant from my step mom. I don't know if it's because of the pandemic, I'm honestly not sure. She asked me if I had noticed, and I told her I had.\n\nA week ago, dad got a new phone, and he always gives me his old phone when he decides to upgrade, and it's always a huge upgrade for me from my current phone. I always make sure to reset it to factory settings and this keeps the \"new phone\" excitement. Two days ago, I was testing out the camera when I noticed some pictures and videos on the phone that were stored on the Micro SD that was left in the phone. Apparently those stay even when you return to factory settings. One of the videos I found was a video of my dad masturbating. My step mom never goes on business trips or anything, so why he would take a video like this? I decided to confront him.\n\nWhen I did, he looked like he had seen a ghost. He said to delete the video immediately and to never speak of it again. I asked him why he would take a video like this, and he said it's none of my business, and he made me delete the video in front of him(I saved a copy on a flash drive prior), and he said if I ever spoke about to anyone, particularly my step mom, that he was kicking me out and cutting me off completely.\n\nThis infuriated me. He was obviously cheating on my step mom. My dad is at work (he works night shift), so I asked her if I could email her a video I had found and if she could watch it in private (I didn't want to be there when she watched it, and the video was on a flash drive on my laptop). She looked puzzled, but she said sure.\n\nAfterwards, she asked me where I got the video and I told her everything. She said she had never seen the video before, and that she had been suspicious of him having an affair and this confirmed it. She started packing her bags, and she told me she is leaving. My dad doesn't know about any of this yet, but he will be home in a few hours. She's going to confront him then and most likely leave afterwards for good. I'm worried that I made a huge mistake. My step mom is the the closest thing I have to a real mom, and she is leaving. I have no idea what's going to idea when he gets home. I'm lost.\n\nUpdate 1 and 2 are in the comments.\n\nUpdate 3: For those that didn't get the chance to see my first updates, my dad WAS having an affair. My step mom had her suspicions this entire time, and this confirmed it. And he admitted to having an affair during her confrontation when he arrived home from work. She left and he followed her separately. I still haven't heard from my step mom, and I'm currently staying at a friend's house. My dad doesn't know I'm here but I have dozens of missed calls from him. I have a lot of figuring out to do. I don't know if she went back home to get the rest of her things because I've been gone from home since the middle of the night last night. I would have updated sooner but I haven't been on reddit all day. \n\nI understand I was wrong for invading his privacy, but like I said, HE WAS CHEATING on my step mom and she has been nothing but perfect to him. I'll try to keep this post updated when I hear from my step mom so it can finally be closed. She hasn't answered any of my calls or texts and I still haven't spoken to my dad. I have no idea where she is but I still think it's too soon to call the police. She might just need her space.

{"prompt":"An update post to my “I think my son is gay”\n\nA few days ago, I made a post titled “I think my son is gay”, I said that I wanted to get some time off work so that I could talk to him and hopefully get him to come out.\n\nHere is a link to my original post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/afp5jv\/i_think_my_son_is_gay\/?st=JR0QSZ28&sh=ad7bd9c9\n\nI was overwhelmed with lots of helpful advice and now I would like to share with the ones that are interested, how it went!\n\nSo in my original post I said how I wanted to get time off work to spend time with him but sadly I could not do this and instead I got permission from the post office if I can bring my son along on one of my deliveries which they said yes too. I talked to my son on Tuesday and asked if he would be interested in spending some time with me the next day and perhaps come to work with me. I said he could miss a day of school to spend time together. He was happy to spend time with me and he also didn’t seem to mind waking up early to come.\n\nSo yesterday came and we are both waking at around 6:30am we both get washed, have our breakfast and we get ready. We jump in the post van and we head to the post office. I noticed I had a bigger delivery than usual which was good because it meant I had more time to be with my son.\n\nWe begin driving and start our conversations small I ask how he has been doing at school and things like that (my son is 16). What I didn’t mention in my first post is that my son isn’t my biological son, his real dad left when he was 12 and his mother (my wife) died in 2011.\n\nEventually we came by a very convenient charity which was to help prevent violence against gay youths. I pulled over so that we could go check it out, I believed that if he saw me donating money and talking about how gay people should be able to be accepted it will help him think I’m open to gay people. I donated £10 and we got back in the post van and this is when he says “Tim, what made you do that?” I explained that I don’t think it’s right that gays are seen as different people and said that if my son was gay I would accept him and treat him no different. He went quiet and about 30 minutes later he says “Tim, I have something to tell you, I’m gay”.\n\nI just stopped the van and began to hug him telling him that I’m proud that he has cane out and told him that he is very brave. We both did some crying and we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald’s.\n\nI’m sorry if this has been a long post but I’m proud of my boy and I wanted to share this with you kind people that helped me. Thank you all!\n\nTL;DR took my son to work with me, donated to a charity to help stop violence against gays, son came out as gay, we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald’s\n\n\nEdit: WHAT THE FRICK!!! So many people replied my goodness I showed my son he was so happy honestly it made his day thank you all so much, I’m speechless, how can you amazing people exist, I won’t question it because it’s been truly amazing honestly can’t express this enough THANK YOU ALL!!!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What a ridiculously unbelievable story\n\nI mean come on\n\nDo you REALLY expect us to believe that McDonald's ice cream machine actually WORKED? Can't fool me.\n\n(Jokes aside this is legitimately a beautiful story and I'm so happy that he has a true father willing to accept who he is and love him unconditionally) END"}
{"prompt":"My bio parents put me (15m) up for adoption when I was born so I was always in foster homes until I was twelve. I had a teacher Janice (33f) who was my home room teacher.\n\n\nJanice found out about me being a foster kid and how I wished I had a family. Janice had also been a foster kid growing up and so long story short she then became my foster mom and adopted me. \n\n\nJanice is the best mom I could have ever asked for. She has been so unbelievably kind and loving to me and I absolutely adore her. The problem is that I don’t call her mom, I just call her Janice. I want to start calling her mom but have no idea how to without making it awkward. Please help me internet strangers.\n\n\nUpdate\nSo….. was not expecting this big of a response. Thank all of you for responding and some of the ideas made me really tear up. Anyways this morning I went to Janice and I said “good morning mom” she just looked at me and started crying then came over and hugged me and kissed my forehead. I hugged her back and she said I could call her whatever made me comfortable and that she loves me more than anything. I just replied with “I love you mom”. \n\n\nSo yeah hope this update makes someone’s day because it certainly made mine.

{"prompt":"English is not my native language so please bare with me to be honest, I just join here to ask monetary assistance on a assistance group here. I am a Muslim girl, just turned 18 and I ran away from our home because my parents is forcing me to marry a guy a lot older than me, I guess he is around 45-50 years old. My parents is asking me to marry him cause my brother saw us in not a good situation and misinterpreted it, he was actually sexually  assaulting me. It is really important on our religion to stay pure until marriage and it is humiliating for them to saw me on that position. I try explaining them what actually happened but they are not listening and just forcing me to marry a disgusting old man. I run away home I just can't accept that I will marry a devil and it hurts me deeply that my family is not believing me.  I ran away home and currently staying at a friend but I can't be here forever. I ran out of money and still trying to look for a job, I cannoy reach out to any relatives because they will notify my parents  I will need to ask assistance to a group here on Reddit but it is not allowing me, asking me for a karma. I don't what that is and really don't know where to get them. I want to run away from my city as far as I can, but I need help from strangers, it is humiliating to ask for assistance there but that's my only way, I tried gofundme as Twitter suggests but it is not available on our country. Please please help me gain karma or tell me what karma on Reddit means. I want to get out of here as early as possible so that my parents will not catch me or if there is any other group that provides assistance without any karma. Thank you so in advance. \n\n\n\nPs. I am really overwhelmed with all your support and warm messages, you've been all a great help and makes it less more depressing. I really apologize for not replying on your comments one by one, it's just that I am just connected to a convenient store WiFi and it's not stable, but I am reading everything and is trying to reply to you all good people. Just to add, I'm from the Philippines. I'm really scared to disclose this, I actually tried asking help on twitter and when I told them I'm a Filipina I was bombarded with a lot of guys trying to buy explicit pictures, because according to them, Philippines is land of cheap woman, but we are not. Please change this mindset. Again thank you and Im almost about to reach my karma goal. ♥️\n\n\n\n\nPSS. thank you all so much. I'm literally crying I have saved everything, links, suggestions and I took screenshot of everything just a remembrance of how good people are. I really wanted to to thank all of you, one by one to show you how grateful I am but I don't know why for some reason it is no longer allowing me to send you a private message and to reply on your comments. I just really need 400 karma, just for me to be able to post on r\/assistance but you give me a lot and I couldn't be more thankful and also to the badges and awards, I really don't know what that means and how to use it but still, thank you, I know that it is special here on Reddit. I have contacted DSWD and they said that they are willing to help but just needed to verify my background first, Im really scared because they might need to contact my parents. But yes, I will already be moving and will need to visit their office. I'm really sorry for dragging you all here, I'm really sorry especially to the ones that message me telling I'm a karma whore, I maybe am, I just needed those karma; I also decided not to post on any community as well including the ones I planned on asking donations and help, i don't know if I can handle any more hate on my private message and it's unfair, I see posts on those communities asking for help because themselves and loved ones who has terminal disease and such, they deserve the donation more than I am. I'm sorry that some of you can't believe my story and telling me hurtful things DMs sorry that I don't want to reply to you guys,  but please as much as possible let's be nice to one another, the world is hard on us already, let's not belittle someone's pain just because you are not experiencing it. \n\n\nI'm forever thankful to all of you. It's a great community and a proof that humanity still exists, I am looking on every option you guys provide. Sorry for being so dramatic, Im just really moved with all of your kindness. Thank you and may Allah and your God's bless you. ♥️\n\n\n\n\nLast edit:  I still have mo words but thank you. Just an update, I still posted on a subreddit asking for assistance but it was removed since I need to be a user for 60 days, I cannot risk on waiting that long, I'm really sorry but is there any other group I can reach out for monetary funds?  I have found a shelter, and they advised me to keep the name on private, a fellow Filipino helped reached them thank you but we are still gathering funds for my transport money. They allow me to stay there and also allowed to hide my religion, I'm sorry but I don't want to practice Islam anymore, I still know that there is God but practicing it's rules is not for me. I wanted to freely express who I am. This might be the last edit I will do. I'm really thankful for all of your help. I will never forget it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What country are you in?

{"prompt":"EDIT1: my sister (who should be a private eye honestly) managed to find his grandparents and their phone number so his grandmother is currently on her way. Thanks to everyone who offered their advice. This is the first time anything like this has happened and I was more concerned with protecting the kid than worrying about the legality of doing so, so thank you for reminding me to do things correctly  \n\n\nEDIT2: I just woke up to an inbox of very mixed feelings from people who think I did the right thing, wrong thing, dumb thing, etc. and I'm sure there will be a similar mix regardless of what I say but here's more details I didn't mention before I went to sleep.\n\n* I live in a predominately black neighborhood in a southern state. I just moved here less than two months ago and haven't seen many police but, from previous experiences, the cops aren't my first choice of who to call.\n* The little boy was also black and reminded me of one of my nephews. I'm 26 and my 18yr nephew (it's my sister's home) was also here with me so I didn't even think of anybody potentially thinking we were doing something to the kid. When I was his age I frequently hung out with the older kid (like 10yrs older) next door and his friends (they never bullied me or made me feel like I was annoying) so as soon as I saw him that's what I was reminded of.\n* As soon as I sat him down on the couch and turned some cartoons on, I went into the other room and facetimed my older sister who lives there but was out of town. She said he was the kid from next door and that she had his uncle's number (who also lives there) and was going to try and call him first because the boy said he wanted either his uncle, or he wanted to go to his older brother's (14) house.\n* His older brother is a half brother from what it seems, and lives with his biological father and his paternal grandparents (so no relation to his mom). The kid told me he doesn't know his real father. \n* He said he didn't have any phone numbers for anyone besides his mom but he knew the name of the street that his older brother lived on, and the names of that kid's grandparents. I told my sister all of this and within like 10mins she had found one of the grandparents and spoke to them on the phone.\n* I have heard horror stories about CPS, the foster care system, and police so forgive me for not immediately choosing those options. Especially as a black man. From my perspective those were not the safest option for the kid.\n* In terms of bruises, he said he had none. He also said it was the first time she'd ever done that but that she threatens to a lot.\n* He said the reason he got in trouble was because his mom thought he had called one of his teachers \"the B-word\" through his virtual learning thing. He said it wasn't him and that someone else must have signed in with his account and typed it. I don't know if I believe the whole story but I thought if he had planned his escape out like this and actually executed then it really must've been that bad of a beating.\n* I asked him if he felt safe at home and his reply was \"I don't feel safe for my little brother\"\n* Since I live next door I'm gonna make sure to keep an eye on him and his little brother and invite them over (I have other nieces and nephews nearby that are his age) even just to make sure his mom knows somebody else is aware of them and is watching\/listening.\n* Oh, and the reason why I thought calling the cops would benefit me more than the child is because it would absolve me from anything like kidnapping, harboring, or child endangerment etc. but would most likely result in one of the cops staying with him talking with him while the other goes to the house and explains what's happening. That would inevitably lead to the kid going right back to that house.\n* The only other element I can think of is that I won't say I fully believe that it is an abusive home because I know of a lot of black moms that spank their kids pretty hard sometimes but still love them to death. It's not always out of hate, sometimes it's because they haven't been taught a better option. So I'm not 100% convinced but I'll definitely make sure they know we've got both kid's backs.\n* Also, in the potential situation where it's not an abusive home but maybe a little too heavy handed\/frequent with the corporal punishment, that genuinely could be a better situation than foster care. Which is all kinds of messed up but a definite possibility.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tell CPS about it... The grandma may send the child back to the abusive home...

I saw some people saying that he could’ve mistaken my sister’s trainer bra for a sports bra, I don’t see how that makes it any less inappropriate. Also my sister’s trainer bra is like 3 times smaller than my bras. But anyways I told my mom that I found my underwear under my brothers bed, I didn’t tell her about her and my sister’s bras. She decided to wait for my dad to get back from work, so we waited until he got home. Once he did my mom told him about my underwear and they both went to my brother’s room to talk to him. My dad was calm but my mom was really mad. She demanded to see the box so my brother showed them the stuff. I could tell my mom was in disbelief. My mom saw my crusty thong and my little sister’s trainer bra and started screaming at him. In my 16 years that I’ve known my dad, I’ve only ever seen him cry once (when my little sister was born) but he was crying now. I left the room to go with my sister while my mom still yelled at my brother. It’s been almost an hour since this happened and my parents haven’t said anything to me. I’m in my room with my sister watching a movie right now. I’ll keep you guys updated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm usually extra-wary while passing judgement about those kind of things, and most definitely I'm NOT keen to jump on the bashing bandwagon, but this is just fucked up.\n\nAt 17 there's **no way** he \"didn't think it through\". Not with his twisted trophies being crusted with a full layer of his special frosting. It's clearly not a one-off deal, a spur of the moment brainfart.\n\nHe had a collection of undergarment with the whole female side of the family represented... If he wanted a bra or some panties, he'd have easily purchased a cheap set somewhere and nobody'd have known.\n\nAlso, while you can sort of kind of make up some excuse for the actual \"sexy stuff\", there's no way around the creepiness about the training bra... Unless OP's sister is a lot \"ahead of the curve\", a 9yo training bra barely qualifies as a bra at all, so the fact he pleasured himself, a lot, to that is very very very disturbing.\n\nWe've all been young, horny and likely frustrated. Many might have wanked to some questionable material once or twice, but having your own stash of stained stolen underwear belonging to your mom and sisters (one of which isn't even in the double-digits) is not \"oh, I found a swimsuit catalogue\" or \"I didn't mean to look up midget granny porn\".\n\nThe guy needs help.

He has seizure disorder, autism, and a litany of other health problems due to brain damage at birth.  \n\nHe was playing something on his N64 I set up for him and I was downstairs playing on my phone. I was house-sitting (technically babysitting) for my parents. (Yes they are in the process of getting him in assisted living\/home for adults with issues like this). \n\nSuddenly out of nowhere I hear a hideous scream, inhuman even. I race upstairs and my brother has the door shut and barred. Horrified, I pound on it and ask what happened and he keeps saying nothing over and over. I demand he open the door and he said no he's busy. He won't tell me what I heard was, or what happened.

He will probably get the door back but not the lock. The eval we were given was really big and complicated but basically stated that it was probably a seizure that triggered a violent episode. If he exhibits any more violent or potentially violent behavior they requested we call 911 right away. We have a social worker assigned to us and they will be visiting my parents and brother on monday morning. Nothing else new to report, except for my reoccurring nightmares.

(btw i have nothing against sex workers) \n\nI will make an update post after our conversation.\n\n\n\n\nI don't know what to do, I (18M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) for around 9 months now and last night, we were hanging out and she randomly told me that if she had the opportunity to sell her nudes online or to people around us, that she would do it. \n\nThat made me extremely upset internally, because I'm an insecure person and knowjng that she would do that stuff for other guys makes me sick to my stomach. I havent told her how i feel yet.\n\nBefore she was \"officially\" my girlfriend she asked me if i would date someone like Belle Delphine, and I said no, because that would make me insecure about the relationship and because exclusivity is important to me and she still decided to accept to be my girlfriend.\n\nShe also said that it's okay for her to do it, since she wouldnt mind if I did it. But the thing is that I feel like thats not fair, because no one would want to see me naked (not that im interested in selling nudes) and shes Literally a model so tons of people will definately watch her nudes. Obviously, my opinion is stupid and probably wrong, but it still makes me feel like shit and idk what to do and how to tell her that i would really like her not to sell her nudes. \n\nBasically what im looking for is advice on either, how to get over that insecurity about other guys\/girls seeing her naked OR someone to tell me if its okay for me to be upset by this? im so conflicted, because on one hand, i want us to remain exclusive and feel comfortable in our relationship, but on the other, I dont want to keep her from doing something that she might want to start doing for money one day.\n\nalso please tell me if i would be an asshole for trying to get her to not get into that kind of stuff.\n\nIf my issue isnt clear, feel free to ask any question.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Here’s the thing, you shouldn’t feel like an asshole for not necessarily being on board. We are allowed to disagree with the choices of our significant others, however, it is entirely up to them if they want to continue to make that decision. It seems like she already knew you weren’t the type of person to be okay with it, but it also seems like you’re the type of person who knew that she would consider it? So the question is which one of you will budge when it comes to deciding what will happen. I don’t think either one of you should necessarily give up your position for the sake of the other person, I think you guys should sit down and have a real conversation about if there was a possibility to make this work for both of you and keep the relationship comfortable and open in terms of communication throughout it. You should also ask her what her motivation behind this is, financially, emotionally, for fun? It varies with a lot of different women what they want to get out of setting up a business like this. And don’t lie to yourself, if it’s not something you’re comfortable with don’t let those feelings fester and cause tension in a relationship that otherwise may not have any other issues. Basically the main thing here is going to be having a long, in-depth, honest conversation with her and hope that she is willing to reciprocate that honesty as well. END"}

But when I ask them where they are or when they think they’ll be coming home they just sort of avoid the question. \n\nI’m starting to get really worried, especially since they now saying I should use their credit card they left here to like, buy groceries if I need to, which I’m taking to mean they’re not coming back for at least another week.\n\nI have no idea what to do. Do I call the police? Again they’re not missing, they just won’t come back home for some reason. But my brother is starting to get worried now too. If anyone has any advice please do share it because I’ve never been this confused in my life\n\nUPDATE - I posted this update earlier as it’s own post, but it was removed as updates are supposed to be added to the original text unless they are asking for additional advice, which mine was not. Here’s the original update however:\n\nHey everyone. I just wanted to make this post so that you all know what’s going on now and that we’re okay.\n\nMy grandparents are here at the house with us now. They called back as soon as they got the voicemails I left and immediately started heading this way. I feel a lot better now that they are here. They called the police once they got here. They talked to them, I talked to them. All that we really did is tell them everything I said in the original post I made and showed them my texts with them. We don’t have much more information then that.\n\nMy grandpa called our dad and I think he actually spoke to one of the police officers. I don’t know what he said though, other than he still won’t tell anybody where they are. So we still have no idea what they’re doing or why they left. I promise I’ll make another update when I know more. Please have patience though. I’m trying to cooperate with an investigation now. They’re bringing the police dogs over to sniff around the house and I’m so nervous and I don’t even know why.\n\nThis post is really just to let everyone know that our grandparents are here now and we are fine and alright. And I just want to thank everybody for helping out and being so supportive. And was really freaking out last night and I appreciate all the kind words. I’ll update when I can\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You need to call a trusted adult right away. Aunt, uncle, grandparents, close family friends.. someone! Tell them what is going on.

{"prompt":"Disclaimer: Throw away, because my Step dad and his friends are active on reddit. On mobile as well. \n\nTW: Incest, sex, high risk pregnancy, mention of death. \n\nMy mom had me at 18 right out of high school. long story short my dad died at 19 while he was away at uni. Then my mom re-married at 21 and had my sisters. My step dad, we’ll call him Scott, was the only father I’ve know, he’s been a great father, nothing out of the ordinary. Absolutely perfect parenting until I turned about 19. \n\nI remember Scott was becoming a little more touchy then normal, and a little too personal. He would offer me wine (I declined) and would ask me about my sex life after one too many glasses. I bushed it off because I thought maybe he was being a nosey father and just wanted to make sure his daughter wasn’t having sex? \n\nThen, this kind of stuff continued, to the point where my step dad tried to kiss me last year. I told my mom and she just laughed and told me “that’s how he gets after too many drinks” I knew then I had to make plans to leave, so I started saving up. After that incident things died down a bit until my mom got pregnant at 39. It’s a higher risk pregnancy so she’s on a lot of bed rest, and taking extra care of herself per her doctor. \n\nA couple weeks ago, my mom and Scott sat me down and told me her doctor said she should avoid sex during her pregnancy due to various health reasons I won’t get into. They asked me if I could have sex with Scott just until she was able to have sex again. Of course, I said no! I was livid, I was crying. She told me she’d be okay with it, and she’d be in the room as well. I told her that was even worse! Like what are they thinking? \n\nI have enough money now for an apartment, I got approved, I’m signing my lease next week. My parents are ignoring me and the whole house it full of tension. My younger sisters don’t understand what’s going on and my mom told me not to say anything. But my sisters are smart they know something is really up, and won’t stop asking me about it, especially the oldest. She came to me crying today and told me I better tell her what’s going on right now. I didn’t say anything. \n\nSo any advice? What do I tell her? What do I say to the younger ones? How do I tell a 16 year old about this without being inappropriate or bashing my parents?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You need to call CPS.

{"prompt":"***UPDATE***\nSince someone asked me to update everyone on this mess here it goes. \n\nI told my fiancee it's over. I can't be with someone who abandons their kid because they're gay. That's just something I'm not willing to accept or forgive.\n\nI got her an AirBnB for the next month and gave her cash to rent an apartment after that month is over and I'll move her stuff when she gets her own place. I know this is probably too generous considering she just kicked out her kid without any remorse. But I'm not her. I'm not capable of doing that. Especially since I still love her despite what she did. She left an hour ago. \n\nI called her daughter and explained what happened. I told her she can move in with me. She was super happy and asked me to pick her up in a couple of hours. \n\nI'm not her father and I never had any kids of my own but I'll try my best to take care of her both financially and emotionally. Raising a teenager will definitely be a challenge but one that I'm happy to accept if it means she doesn't have to go through what I went through when I was her age. \n\nFor the people that said to call CPS or to get legally custody of her, there's no point. In my country a 16 year old isn't considered a minor anymore. Which means she can legally live with anyone she chooses without parental consent. And as far as adopting her or getting legal custody, I'm not her dad. I wouldn't pretend to be. I'll just take care of her till she wants to or is ready to move out. \n\nI really hope that both of them reconnect. But my fiancee isn't welcome at my house anymore. I don't want her in my life. I haven't told my fiancee that her daughter is going to be living with me. If her daughter chooses to tell her herself that's her choice. I'm not going to force her to reconnect or keep in touch with her mother. \n\nI appreciate everyone's advice on this. I never thought Reddit would be this helpful. \n\n***ORIGINAL POST***\n\nI've been with my fiancee for 4 years. I'm 30 and she's 39. She has a 16 year old daughter. \n\nThey moved in with me after we've been together for about 6 months. I never really got involved with the parenting of her daughter. It wasn't my place and I never had kids so I don't have any experience especially with teenagers. \n\nTwo years ago I caught her daughter with another girl when I came home from work. She begged me not to tell her mom so I didn't. It's not my place to discuss her sexuality. \n\nYesterday her daughter came home from school with a girl and came out to her mom. She flew into this rage and started cussing and calling her daughter names. And then she kicked her out and told her not to come back till she's \"normal\".\n\nMy fiancee is very Christian. So to her being gay is a sin. I tried to reason with her but she doesn't care. She doesn't want to see her daughter again. \n\nHer daughter went to stay with her girlfriend and her parents. I've been in contact with her and told her I'd try to persuade her mom to let her back in. But I don't see that happening. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm honestly disgusted with the way she reacted. I don't want her daughter to be homeless. She's a good kid and our relationship has been pretty good. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated. And I apologize for any grammar errors English isn't my first language.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is a great time to tell your fiancée to get out of your house and your life, because you want nothing to do with a homophobic bully who is emotionally abusing her own daughter.\n\nThe money you were thinking of putting toward finding this appalling woman a place - put it toward finding housing for the kid instead. Support the victim, not the abuser. The kid is the one who needs your help. Your ex is a grown adult asshole who can figure out how to put a roof over her head by herself. If she thinks kicking someone out on no notice is okay enough that it can be done to a child, she’s very clearly saying it’s a reasonable thing to do to her too.\n\nOh, and make clear to the kid that she is welcome to come back any time, either to get her stuff or to stay, and it’s her mother who will be leaving if she has a problem.\n\nFor the future, don’t date fundamentalists with obnoxious, bigoted beliefs. This can’t be the first you heard of her believing this. When you get involved with people whose fundamental beliefs are judgemental, cruel and incoherent you are setting yourself up for this problem. END"}

I just finished my education when we started dating and I have been doing all sorts of jobs since. Sometimes two at a time. I did this to expand my resume and gather job experience.\n\nI worked in cafés, bookstores, a library, a grocery store and as an English tutor. Most of those jobs lasted about 3 to 5 months. My shortest stay was 2 and a half weeks, my longest 8 months, but since I didn't have a hard time applying for new positions, I tried to block it out, though it was kind of eating me up internally.\n\nPeople called to complain about me, people left bad reviews about me, people used my employee wifi access to look up sketchy things on the internet under my name, former 'employees' called to 'inform' them about me, right name and all, and much much more subtle stuff that I couldn't disprove. But I was too anxious to do anything about it. I just told my girlfriend, she comforted me, she supported me every time I got my life ruined by these people. But I kept going, though they kept finding me.\n\nFast forward to this week. I currently hold a part-time position at a bakery, I've been working there for two months and a half. It's going okay, but my manager approached me about something regarding our google reviews.\n\nSomeone was complaining about an employee, and their description of them could only really fit me. It was on a day where we're pretty short of staff, so I could've been the only person in the store on that day for all I know. Anyway, their review contained some pretty elaborate and nasty comments about me. This has happened on one or two of my jobs already.\n\nI told my manager that it was all pretty bogus and that someone had a vendetta against me, as it has happened before. She believed me, and told me that she'll dismiss the comment. On my break, I checked out the review myself. Their username was kinda stupid, I'm not gonna type it out here since I still work there, but I'll just call them \"Mick Myrtle\" as it was in the same range of sounds-kinda-fake-but-not-really. Anyway, I come home but don't tell Janice about it. She has heard it all before, so I didn't see the point in complaining about another time I almost lost my position.\n\nWe chat, all is well, and she leaves the room. Her phone is on the table, and suddenly, she get's a notification or an email of some sort from google. I don't remember what it said exactly, but the popup read something along the lines of \"Mick Myrtle: 'Manager' has responded to your Review!\"\n\nMy heart dropped. I've been trying to ignore it since. this was two days ago. It just fit in the picture of bad reviews. It fit in the picture of the phoned complains my workplaces have received about me in the past. It fits in the picture of all the sketchy things I've been fired for.\n\nWhy would she do that, though? I'm looking for an explanation. This literally can't be. She's the only thing keeping me sane. I don't know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is extreme manipulation and abuse!

First of all, thank you. I can't say that enough. \n\nThanks to so many of you who commented different organizations who could help my daughter and I, we are now safe. \n\nI got in touch with a few organizations and one of them was able to get my daughter and I on a plane on Christmas Eve. I left our things, with the exception of whatever we could fit in two suitcases and left without saying a word. We arrived that night and some amazing people from the organization were there to pick us up and take us to housing. \n\nWe can stay here for up to 18 months, but I totally plan on getting on my feet before then. They have childcare, connections to lawyers, psychologists... Everything we need. They had an apartment ready for us, with a Christmas tree and everything. They had presents for my daughter to open on Christmas morning and even a couple for me as well. \n\nWe have now been here for 6 nights and for the first time since my daughter was born, I have had a full nights rest. I have talked to a lawyer who is helping me get an order of protection so that if we were ever found, I know I will be protected by the law. \n\nI feel like I can do anything. I can go to school, I can get whatever job I want, I can spend time with my daughter without being in fear. This is such a blessing. I feel like I can live my life. \n\nFor the past 2 1\/2 years, I have been stuck in the mindset that to protect my daughter and myself, I couldn't act young. It was work and home every. single. day. Getting to separate myself from my terrible situation made me realize that I can be a responsible mother for my daughter and be 20 years old. I get to enjoy being a young a parent. It doesn't have to be so scary. \n\nSo once again, thank you to everyone who helped. I wish I could hug every single one of you in person. I am eternally grateful. \n\nAnd so I don't break any rules of the subreddit...

{"prompt":"I, 28f, am currently 19 weeks pregnant. My partner, 29M, and I are very excited, as this is our first baby and we have been trying for a few months.\n\nWe announced the pregnancy a month ago at a dinner party we hosted, and everyone seemed surprised and overjoyed. My sister, 35f, who I will call K, immediately burst into tears and asked me how I could do this to her. I stared at her, and asked “What?” She started ranting, saying that I always got everything I wanted (which is not true, I worked hard for all that I have) and that she knew I got pregnant just so I could rub her infertility in her face.\n\nShe screamed at me for 5 minutes about how I didn’t deserve to be a mother and she should be the one pregnant right now. My parents left with her soon after, and the party was basically over. I was really disturbed by my sister's reaction, because we had been pretty close before, and she had never done anything like this.\n\nK called me the next day, apologizing for how she acted at my announcement and asked if we could meet up for coffee. I accepted. We met up and she pretended as nothing had happened. Then she started a big speech about her infertility, how heartbreaking it is to be growing life inside of her, just to lose it, and how she had always wanted children of her own. She then proceeded to ask me if I could consider getting an abortion, to make things “fair”, or letting her adopt my baby. I stared at her and asked if she was serious. K said she was. I just dropped my part of the bill on the table and left.\n\nL texted me a rant that night about how I’d made K cry, and how all they wanted was to be parents, and that this meant so much to them, and I “owed” them for being more successful than them. I and my partner invested many years into our jobs, and we have worked very hard to earn what we earn now. I told them that my partner and I had been hoping for kids too and that I was not giving up my baby. He hung up.\n\nShe later sent me a long letter (4 pages) about how she had always wanted to be a mother, and could I consider either abortion or letting her adopt my baby, how I should care about my older sister's happiness, how she would make a better mum, how the oldest kid should have the first grandchild, and how I could always just have another baby since it was \"so easy for me to conceive\".\n\nAfter that, she quieted down some, and I thought we were done with this. Except... it wasn't. She had posted MY SONOGRAM on her FB, and captioned it “L and I are expecting! We can’t wait to meet our little princess!”\n\nI was seeing red. I texted her and demanded she takes the post down. No reply.\\`\\` I texted L. No reply. So I called my mother and told her what happened. She was able to make K take the post down, luckily enough. K has called me petty for calling my mum and has continued to demand I give up my baby. I sent her a letter explaining that I had had enough of her nonsense, I AM keeping my baby, and that I recommend she get some help. I added that if she continues, I will not hesitate to call 999.\n\nThis weekend, however, was the absolute last straw. My mum and dad have the spare key to my house, and while she was over at their house for brunch, she took the key. While my partner and I were at work, she broke into our house and stole all the clothing, blankets, nappies, bottles, and pretty much any other item we had bought for the baby, except furniture. It was later returned after my mum found it in her car. I called 999, but they told me I couldn't do anything because I had no proof and because it was all returned.\n\nMy partner and I are moving in April, but I'm still scared my sister will find out where we live and take my child. I get that she's upset and jealous, due to her infertility, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up my baby. My parents know about this, and they have been doing their best to get her some help. She doesn't want to adopt, because she wants a child that's her own flesh and blood. I'm due in August, and the stress she's causing cannot and will not be good for me or the baby. My partner is looking into a cease-and-desist letter. Is there anything else I should do or say? I'm scared for my baby.\n\n**UPDATE 28-3-22**\n\nThe support I've received from this website is overwhelming! Thank you all for your comments, although I couldn't reply to all of them, they are appreciated! We have had the locks changed, cameras installed, and a Ring doorbell. I've started saving every letter and screenshotting every message my sister has sent and plan to take them to court for a restraining order very soon. We have also been seriously documenting everything.\n\nMy husband and I are planning a trip to Ireland for our anniversary next week, and it's going to be good to clear our heads from my sister. I've called 999 to report her for harassment, and they gave her a warning. She's contacted me saying that if I won't give her my child, I can at least pay for multiple rounds of IVF, which I have not replied to other than refusing. She's been begging my parents to convince me to give up my baby, which they refuse to do. They have also been given a statement that basically says that if they give her my contact information, they will not see my baby, to which they have agreed.\n\nI've since changed my phone number, and we are moving very soon. My sister does not know our new address. She actually stood on our stoop for 20 minutes a few days ago, banging on our door, and yelling. My husband opened a window and told her that if she didn't leave, he would let the dog out, and threatened to call the police. We have a rather small, but hyper puppy who jumps on everyone and barks a lot, and she is quite scared of dogs, actually, so this made her leave. I started working from home last week, as did my husband, and we've followed the advice of one of the comments, washed all of the baby stuff, as well as made sure none of the food in our kitchen was messed with (none was, luckily).\n\nWe're planning on getting a restraining order as soon as possible, and are looking forward to our trip! I'm already sick of being pregnant, and I'm not even in the third trimester. I just want my baby. Thank you all again for your wonderful advice, and I may update you again when the baby is born.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You should block her number, get a restraining order, move far, far away, and never speak to her again.

And it was a feeling in the moment, if any of you can understand that.\n\nI will update as everything in this situation unfolds.\n\nIf you private message me or try to chat there are like a hundred so I am sorry if I don’t respond it’s just a bit overwhelming.\n\n***Fourth update***\n\nMy life has been such a rollercoaster these past couple weeks.

{"prompt":"So just over 4 months ago I gave birth to my 4th and last child, It was a high risk pregnancy and the birth was very difficult, I wont go into detail as it is still hard for me think about, Me and baby are  both fine now.\n\nMy doctors advised me that it would be best to not have anymore kids and I agreed, My husband just recently had a vasectomy and is now recovering.\n\nMy sister and her boyfriend have tried planning for a family for awhile but recently found out she can't conceive, She has been very upset about this and I do feel sorry for her.\n\nOur family mentioned adoption or surrogacy for them and even though my sisters boyfriend was on board my sister said she needed time to think.\n\nWell a couple nights ago my sister called me to tell me her and her boyfriend had agreed on surrogacy and we talked for a bit, after awhile she brought up the fact how I had done so well in all my pregnancies and how I must have loved being pregnant.\n\nI knew exactly where this was going and reminded her how my last pregnancy was and yet her she told me everything was fine now so what was my issue.\n\nI told her that even though I'm around now I wont put myself through that again and just because I am fine now doesn't mean everything will be fine the next time.\n\nShe then straight up asked me if I will be her surrogate or not, I straight up told her no, she then started screaming into the phone about how selfish I am and how I need to look out for my sister and help her when she needed it.\n\nI then told her I would help her with anything else but I was not putting my  own health at risk and potentially leave my kids without a mom and my husband a widow, My sister went on to continually scream about how selfish I was being and how much a bitch I was being, I hung up on her, I didn't think about it and went to bed.\n\nThe next morning my phone was blown up with fb messages and calls from friends and family, My sister had gone on fb after I hung up on her and she went and bitched on fb about me, She went on about how I wouldn't let her being a mom and how I had 4 kids while not being a nice sister and give her a baby, I was apparently being selfish. My mom and small handful of people are extremely angry at me and calling me all sorts of names for being selfish, while my dad, brothers and several other people are taking my side.\n\nEveryone on my sister's side don't want to hear my side of the story they think I'm doing this for my own selfish intentions and not my health.\n\nMy mom and dad have been fighting back and forth now because my dad wont take my sister's side, and this is exactly like when were kids, my mom would always take her baby's side, I'm extremely pissed off that this has caused problems to the point my sister gets family involved.\n\nI should not have to put my own health at risk for her.\n\nI don't think I'm being selfish at all, but I'm not sure how to fix this\n\nEdit 1: I will not give up or \"donate\" one of my kids to my sister\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm the infertile sister in my family and I'm sorry to say she may never get over this.

She needs counseling and your mom needs to back off. My best advice would be to focus on your own health and little family, and if you aren't reliant on your mom and extended family for help some breathing room sounds like a good idea. END"}
{"prompt":"A few days ago my sister(29) killed herself, but before she did she called me and said to take her daughter (the father is a domestic abusing piece of shit, no way in hell im letting him have her)\n\nThing is, i am a single homeless 24 year old man, i have no car, no money no nothing, i’m only managing myself enough to finish uni, my friends and university helped me and gave me 1500$ so i can go pick up my niece and they said they’ll help me out to get a job asap, and temporarily housing me & my niece. \n\nI have my niece with me right now, were in a coffee shop and i bought a cake for her but she’s not eating it, she hasnt eaten anything in the last day or so, shes stopped smilling after i told her what happened to her mom. \n\nhonestly, i have no clue what to do, i have absolutely 0 clue on how to talk to children let alone care for one and be a good parent (or uncle for that matter)\n\nI’m thinking of taking her to children’s therapy to help her process this trauma and make sure she’s okay and getting past it and all that, but now, how do i take care for a 9 year old girl?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" She's in shock, obviously. It will take her a long time to accept what has happened.  Children's therapy is really an excellent idea.\n\nRemember: \n\n* You don't have to be homeless forever\n* Raising a child is not something that you do at a single point in your life \n* From the little you've written, my feeling is that you would probably be the best person to raise this girl.\n\nLife is full of twists and turns. It's hardly ever easy. It's almost always worthwhile to invest yourself as fully as possible into having a better life.  It may not be easy convincing the authorities to comply with your sisters' wishes. It would really help if there were some sort of written trace of her wishes, or if she had told someone other than you.\n\nI would recommend that you do your best to get a job, find work, and put yourself into a situation where you could, realistically, take charge of your niece.  She may be placed temporarily either with your father, or with child protective services (or their equivalent), but that's not necessarily a final decision.\n\nYou also need to contact a social worker TODAY to learn more about what types of assistance there may be.

{"prompt":"First off let me start by saying i do not know what im typing, i do not know what im thinking, i have never felt like this before. Im not mad, not sad, not angry, not happy, ive never fult such nothingness before.\n\nAnyways i have the rest of this month and the next month in my current home. After that im going homeless. All i have is a car and a few assets that can get a few bucks but not much to my name. I dont know if im allowed to talk about suicide but im going to be honest in my post; if the time comes and i havent found any hope or even a step 1, im going to kill myself. I dont want to die, but i dont want to live this life. I am not depressed or anxious or whatever, im good in the head, but recent events have taken their toll on me.\n\nForgot to mention thje important details, i am 19, just finished my first semester in Computer Science in university (and probably my last semester) and i do not work. I live in Lebanon. I do not have a passport to another country. I do not have anyone that can support me. I am completely alone and have a bit of money(1-2k ish) left if i sell my car and all i own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess the advice im asking for here is what should i do? Is there any hope? also please note i live in Lebanon; basically shit internet, shit electricity, no social benifits or whatever no nothing. This country is worse than a 3rd world. i probably miswed a lot of important details, but im struggling to think straight. Feel free to ask me anything (doesnt matter if its personal) related to the matter. Thank you for reading my reddit post. have a good day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I cannot begin to explain how i feel. I never thought anyone would care this much. I am not good with expressing myself but thank you to each and everyone who replied. It really is helping way more than you think. This is going to be a ramble but here goes. As to everyone asking me not to give up, i hope i dont. i want to figure this out and be on top i really do. i will try my best. i hope on day in the future i can come back and update you guys with a happy ending. i havent cried in a long time and you guys have brought emotions i thought were long gone. so thank you for that. I am trying to reply to every single reply but so many are coming in so fast, so for those that i miss, i am very sorry. Eventually i will get to it and i thank you in advance. So for those who are interested, i have concluded from all the replies a general plan that i would like to share for some criticism. First thing i should do is find a job, which i am trying my best to do. After i find a job i will try and find the cheapest\/best rent i can and live on the bare minimum while saving up as much as i can. Now here is where i get a little lost. i know i should get a certain amount of money before considering immigration but have no idea what estimate that consist of, so help on that would be amazing. Next i will contact embassies (Canada and Sweden have been good suggestions so far) for help regarding immigration or a student visa. Also any help regarding immigration would be amazing as i have no clue how all that works. now that im typing that i feel like im asking for too much. i really dont deserve the support you guys have given me today, i cant thank you enough. Anyways that is the general plan, and i know for a fact once i land in a country better than Lebanon i will thrive. i know i can. All i need is a half decent government behind me that wont steal my money. thats it. i dont want rights, i dont want jack shit. i just want my hard earned money. So yeah this is probably the worst paragraph of words to read, so for those of you who did, thank you. My brain is barely functioning i feel like now, so this took a lot of energy to type. Thank you yet again to each and every single one of you. i mean it. I hope to update you guys soon on what happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: I think i have finally replied to every single comment i got. If i get more replies during the night i will answer them tomorrow. I wanted to say thank you again everyone for everything you did. Also to everyone asking to donate, please go donate that money to a charity of your choice. I will be going to bed now, and i wanted to emphasize how much this all means to me. You guys changed me today. Thank you again. i cannot say that enough. I hope one day i will be posting an update with a happy ending. Thank you for your best wishes and hope to talk to you again soon reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Hello everyone, i just woke up and got a shower and hopped on the computer. I am still in shock with everyone's support. i still cant thank you enough. I am reading through all the comments but i am afraid i do not have enough time to reply to all of them. I just want you guys to know i am reading your comments and i appreciate it way more than you think. Today is a big day for me; will be roaming around looking for jobs, need to setup some emergency foods and such. Lots to do today. Your support is giving me strength beyond what i thought i had. You guys have proven that people still care, there is hope. I will be updating you whenever i can, as i now consider you guys my friends. Also dont forget im reading your replies, and i really really appreciate it very much. Regarding looking for online jobs, i will try to make up a decent resume of sorts when i get back home and see what i can find. I really shouldn't be asking for more help from you guys, as you have done way more than enough, but i thought id ask ; i still have a few bucks remaining in my paypal, nothing worth cashing out though i was wondering if maybe like i can invest it or gamble it or of the sorts. Im obviously not counting on it, neither am i a gambler, just trying to give an example. Just a thing i can try my luck in see if it can help. Again, thank you to each and everyone one of you. i keep repeating myself but as i keep saying, im bad at expressing myself. I just want you guys to know i really appreciate everything. Will update you soon, have a good day everyone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" i read your entire post and i just want to let you know that i’m here for you if you need to talk. i sadly don’t know much about lebanon. but in your country right now is it possible for you to find a decent job? even if it’s being a server or some beginner level job? if you have a car you could live there until you collect enough money to rent. \nif you want to move,Canada (where i live) is very open to immigration, it might be hard right now with COVID but you could look into it. if your grades are good you could even apply for a student visa and apply for a uni here. \nBut immigrating still costs a lot of money so you would need to work a bit to collect enough money to pay for the application and everything in between. \ncan i ask how you got to this situation?

{"prompt":"Didn’t know where to post this. Sorry if it’s the wrong place. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a way. \n\nAt uni years ago, I lived in a big house share at the top of the house. One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. \n\nShe had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. \n\nI was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. \n\nI never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. \n\nIf a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can’t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. \n\nI’m not sure how to feel about this and i think that’s why I’m writing. If I am over blowing feeling this way and I should just man up then please tell me. I just want to not feel such resentment as it’s bringing me down. But I don’t know how to.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: i really only expected a few replies, so this has overwhelmed me. I haven’t been able to thank everyone but I really appreciate all the replies. The funny thing is, this thread has been cathartic and almost helped to give me some kind of closure in a way which I never expected. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You sound like you're being pretty clear-headed about this. It doesn't sound out of proportion. \n\nWhat she did was absolutely wrong. It doesn't matter who's what gender; her behaviour was unacceptable. I'm really sorry you had to go through with it. \n\nThat's pretty astounding hypocrisy on her part, and it's reasonable for you to be upset. Just please don't let it eat you alive; don't let her have that kind of control over your life. I'm not sure if this is healthy, but for me, telling myself that he wins if I let that experience own me helped a lot (thanks, snarky best friend - she knew what to say, lol). \n\n(There's a chance that she's realized she messed up and actually changed her behaviour, but I'm inclined the think that she hasn't. I'm cynical, and I think the kind of person who could casually do something that serious and never apologize is likely to continue behaving badly.) END"}
{"prompt":"I have been preparing to defend my cruiser weight belt against a young man from Pakistan. I found him to be a very likeable individual and struck up a friendship with him. He revealed to me that he was a closeted gay (which there are still some taboos about in boxing given the fact it is a blood sport and aids). Although, I have little knowledge of the LGBT community, I felt honoured that he trusted me enough to share this. \n\nI then did something rather foolish, I sent him an arrogant text telling him that “if you can take my crown, you would make a great ambassador for our sport.”\n\nA couple of days later he came out openly as gay to his family and community on Facebook. A short while after this, I have heard that he has been found dead and it is looking like one of his uncles is has murdered him. \n\nI feel sick at this and responsible for having possibly encouraged him to come out as gay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Breathe. It's terrible that that happened and I'm very sorry, but you had NOTHING to do with it.\n\nFirst of all, your text didn't even reference his sexuality in any way. It was just a nice, friendly text in a competitive spirit. So I seriously doubt that text had anything to do with his decision, nor that he really thought about that one single text all that much.\n\nSecond of all, it was his choice to come out as gay. And there's nothing wrong with that choice. The fault lies with the people who hurt him; not with him, and not with you. Even if you HAD somehow inspired him to come out openly, that only means that he felt safe & comfortable talking with you about it. Which is a good thing. It was not wrong of you to make him feel that way.\n\nThird of all, you can't be responsible for a murderer. Whoever did this horrific act, is insane. That's not within your control. Nor could you have ever possibly foreseen something like this happening. So don't blame yourself. END"}

To my friends mom i am seen as a threat to her, her daughter, and her boyfriend for absolutely no reason.\n\nEdit: I informed my mom about the whole situation (she was formally friends with my friends mom) and she told me that she has a multitude of mental problems and even accused my mother of being the reason her first husband left her. (He apparently had a fetish for latinas and both me and my mom are Brazilian immigrants) She’s been envious of my mom since they met and now I’m at a visually mature age she’s portraying it on me as well.

{"prompt":"This is a whole cluster fuck so strap in. Also going to post on a legal sub.\n\nI (17f) was browsing tumblr one day when I came across this blog with a familiar face as the pfp- it was a girl from my school. She was 2 years below me and I didn't know her name, but we took the same bus and she was in some of the same classes as my brother. He was also friends with her cousin.\n\nAt first I looked because I was curious but after a few posts, I realised this was a Ted Bundy stan account. I was very disturbed- most of it was cringy flower crown edits, but there was the occasional text post where she would say disgusting things about the victims and say she wish she knew a serial killer, etc, etc.\n\nAt one point, I found a picture of bloody wrists and the caption led me to believe it was her. I ss every post and her pfp and anything that proved it was her and contacted our school. My hope was that they would intercept and talk to her and the parents about her online behaviour and get her help.  I did it all anonymously and was told that she had been spoken to and action was being taken. That was the last I heard of it for around 5 months. I did check her account regularly because I was genuinely worried, but nothing else was posted other than a simple text post saying 'goodbye friends'. I thought that was the end of it until a month ago. I found out from my brother that she had committed suicide.\n\nI was devastated. I never really knew this girl yet I felt like I had lost someone. My brother (because he was in her year and had a connection to her) was getting updates as they happened from her cousin. Well, in her note, she blames the person who contacted the school (me) and says I was the reason she did this. Of course no one other than the school knows it's me, but I feel bad.\n\nI've been through this stuff before, and I know it's not my fault, but for some reason this hits different. There is more legal stuff that I need advice on, which I will post next on the right sub, but this is more for emotional support.\n\nHow do I get over this?\n\nEDIT: wow it's the next day and there's a lot of messages to read.

Also, the virus is kind of fucking up everyone and a dumb legal case is the least of anyone's worries.\n\nTo the people saying it was my fault and I shouldn't have reported her, I don't know what to say to you. I saw myself in this girl and I did what I thought was right at the time. Her account (or blog) was public and I was concerned. There were a lot of disturbing posts. Sorry if that upsets you.\n\nI don't know what the school or her parents did so I can't comment but yeh.

It seems reasonable to me that constantly viewing all the upsetting images is not good for you.  People are going to post and comment on current events though. That constant media coverage is part of the process. So my advice is for you to filter and limit your exposure. People have a right and a need to express themselves. You have a need to limit the constant negative imagery. So make the choices you need to make to stay healthy. Direct your attention to other interests that provide some relief. Think about activities and interests that you can dive into and take your mind off things.  Good luck. END"}

{"prompt":"I'm in complete mental turmoil.\n\nLong story short, I once had a nice, roughly 7 person very close friend group, one of us had a girlfriend and after they broke up she slept with me one night while we were both drunk at an afterparty (I apologized to the friend profusely for sleeping with his ex and we are on good terms now). Now she's moved on and is dating another one of my close friends, so yeah, she gets around the friend group quite well. Around a year ago, I noticed my friend (with the gf) start to get very distant from me, almost in a mean way. After a while I asked him why, he said his girlfriend didn't want him to talk to me (Understandable on both their parts, I am the guy that slept with his gf, and she likely didn't wanna see her one-night-stand too often) I took his word for it and moved on, okay.\n\nI later start noticing many, many people in our more distant friend group\/ network start blocking me on socials or being straight up awful to me if I reached out to them. I found out that she had told people that I had R\\*ped her. Naturally I was very confused as I had NOT, and we'd actually been somewhat decent friends after we'd slept together (taken classes together and went to a few more parties and whatnot). I tried to reach out to her but she had blocked me, as had all of her close friends so getting through to her would be very hard. Her friends started attacking my friends (who had been there that night and know that nothing bad went down) and it tore my friend group apart.\n\nFast forward a year, and that original friendgroup is down to 3 (i'm fearing 2 soon enough) all my closer friends know I did nothing wrong but seemingly left as the drama was too much to deal with, and I understand that.

My rapist has stalked me since he found out I was pregnant. My daughter is 2 1\/2 now and we have had to move four times since she was born to stay away from him.\n\nI have an active restraining order against him, but it hasn't stopped him once and the police have not been very diligent.

Yes, this has happened more than once.\n\nI work a full time job to ensure my daughter and I have a place to live and because I have no help from family, my daughter goes to daycare. The daycare is fully aware of the active restraining order and have a photo of him on file. He showed up to her daycare last week and I have been too afraid to send her back this week and have taken off work, but if I want to pay my rent next month, I have to go back to work tomorrow.\n\nI trust my daycare.

{"prompt":"I was watching tv in the living room when my dad walked out of his room. He was walking strangely. I said hi to him and he responded in a weak voice that sounded like he was sick. I thought maybe he was just tired. He went in the bathroom and stayed there for a long time making no sound. I asked if he was ok and he mumbled something. Me and my mom were watching the news and he walks out of the bathroom asking what happened in that weak voice again. I asked him \"Is there something wrong with you?\" and he said yes. When I asked him what's wrong, he responded I don't know. Me and mom kept asking \"What's wrong, why are you acting like that? Is something hurting? Did something happen?\" And each time he kept responding \"I don't know.\" My mom asked him how could he not know what's wrong and he bursted out crying \"I don't know!\" I sat by him on the couch and he wouldn't open his eyes. When I asked him if he was in pain he cried saying \"I don't know\" again. Then he went back to his room to sleep. Does anyone know what could be wrong with him? \n\nUPDATE: I called 911 and EMS came and did some tests on my dad. They said he seems to be healthy but should go to the hospital to make sure. He refused. Guess there isn't anything else I can do. Thankfully he doesn't seem to be having a stroke. He's walking and talking normally now. He said he took about 6 sleeping pills and a powerful muscle relaxer so I guess that could be it. Both my parents are really pissed at me for calling 911 but hey better to be safe than sorry! Thanks for all the responses. \n\nCLARIFICATION: I'm getting a lot of comments asking the same questions. My dad has severe insomnia that sometimes causes him to be up for several days. Even the strongest sleeping pills often don't help him. He was prescribed the sleeping pills and muscle relaxer. He didn't take them all at once but over the course of a day. I know my dad isn't suicidal or a drug abuser (except for this instance obviously). Ironically, he's very against any kind of drugs, including prescription, and I often have to force him to take his pills. He probably just had impaired judgement from sleep deprivation. Obviously still very stupid behavior I'll make sure never happens again. People keep saying that he could've had TIA and needs to go to the ER immediately, but since he refuses to go I don't think there's anything I can do. I'll no longer be hesitant to call 911 if something like this ever happens again, but beyond that my hands are tied.

I'm truly devastated.\n\n\n They didn't live in the best area since we all grew up poor and I can't help but feel guilty that I wasn't there to save them. They patiently waited for me to succeed so that when I started my career, I can take them with me and away from the hell we lived in. I eventually stopped going to school and would have panic attacks at my part-time job. I was in a month to month where I was staying while I went to Uni but since I was already living basically on the financial edge (I didn't take any loans out for school) I ended up relinquishing my spot there as well.\n\n  Now, I'm staying with my cousin but living conditions are horrible. He's the messiest, sleaziest person I have ever met but it's the only shelter I have. I only have one uncle and one aunt but they didn't like my mom so they resent me regardless of the situation. There's roaches and ants.. mold on the wall and I just don't feel safe as a woman in this neighborhood let alone at home. Well.. I guess place. I dont have a home anymore.\n\n\n I need advice on how I can start over in another state away from this hell. It's hard for me to go outside after the trauma. I don't sleep and when I do I wake up screaming. I panic when I hear leaves go by outside of the apartment and I'm losing it. Too many memories here. I plan to continue my educational endeavors and work to at least get a room somewhere, I'm just unsure how to start.\n\nI don't know where to look.. I don't know who to trust or who to talk to. I'm trying to stay calm and collect myself but the lack of sleep is making me hallucinate. Please help. \n\nAbout me: I was born in Southern California but was raised in NorCal\/Denmark for most of my life. I'm a female, 23 years old and am of Asian descent.

Last pay period my check was short two hours, it was the first time my check had ever been short. I confronted her and told her, my hours were two hours more than what she had added up on the time card. I showed her how I figured my hours and she told me that she just turned everything into decimals and added them up, like how the pay company told her to do it. However, for 7 hours 30 minutes, she figured 7.3 instead of 7.5. I tried to explain the simple math behind how her figuration was wrong but she assured me she was correct and that she would even ask the pay roll company \"PayChex\" what was correct. She told me, they told her she was correct. On my time card this pay period I wrote 7.5 for 7 days (52.5) and she said I was doing it wrong and that it needed to be 7.3 for 7 days (51.1). She said she would call again and ask them when she called in pay roll. She again stated that they told her .30 was the correct way to write half an hour in decimal form.

I apologize for misgendering in the title, it won't let me edit it.\n\n&ensp;I (m22) met Ex (22) a few years ago and we became good friends. When we met he was his assigned at birth gender(f). We started dating a couple of years ago, and things were going really well. Then about a month ago, he announced to family and friends that he was transgender and would like to be addressed by his new, male name and changed his look to something more masculine. He did not tell me he was doing this beforehand, apparently only his best friend since they were little(BF for short) knew this was happening. I was a bit shocked, but after some thought it made sense and I apologized for not recognizing his internal struggle sooner. \n&ensp;He was excited that everyone of his friends seemed to accept it, as well as family members, and I was happy to see him happier than I ever had before. He mentioned hormone therapy and surgery and how excited\/nervous he was. It wasn't until about three days ago that anyone asked me how I felt as his partner, and I didn't say anything because I didn't want to take away from what I felt was his moment. I knew the conversation had to be had sooner than later. \n&ensp;I took Ex aside and said that I loved him and would be there for him, but if he went through with GR surgery it would be best to break up now. He was understandably upset and I didn't know how else to put it other than \"I'm not attracted to men.\" He seemed to understand, but after I got off work I was met with dozens of messages from BF and a few of mine and his friends calling me a transphobe and doing this when he needed support. Some of my friends even suggested that if I loved him as a woman maybe I'd still be attracted to him as a man, but I don't want to string him along through his transition at the chance our love will overcome my sexual orientation. \n&ensp;I have no idea what to do about this and asking him to tell his friends to back off has been met with silence.\n\nEdit: update in comments\n\nUPDATE: Ex has finally responded to my messages and there has been some fallout with the friends who harrassed me. He only learned the full scope of what was going on last night because he had been ignoring messages while a couple of friends (who were not involved in the harrassing) spent the day cheering him up. He made them all apologize but a couple of his friends and BF added that they still don't like what I did, and I understand because I hurt their friend even if I meant well. I still don't think I'll be hanging around the ones who turned on me except for the one who apologized first because she had been told a slightly dramatized version of events (still not sure who had been telling people this version but at this point I just want to drop it.) Ex and I are going to take some time apart which is difficult but necessary to move on, and I hope we can stay friends when he's ready.

{"prompt":"So I moved in with my dad about 6 years ago to help him around the house because he’s getting up there in his age. Over that time I’ve heard various noises like foot steps and people shushing each other. The first time was several months after I moved in. I was awoken by what sounded like my back door being closed. The door is broken and you need to slam it to get it to close properly. This has since been repaired. \n\nThe next time was experienced by my girlfriend at the time. She claims one night when she was using the guest bathroom in my hallway she could hear footstep above her and muffled voices like a women and a man.\n\nEvery once in a while I’ll hear the footsteps again and very rarely people shushing each other. These sounds originate from the area above my upstairs hallway. This area can not be accessed as it’s on the opposite side of my house from the attic access.

I went into my actual attic and did discover a space beyond the fiberglass sheets. The area is completely unreachable even for a small child. I put my phone into video mode and slid it into the space and hit record. When I watched the video I learned the area is far to confined for a person to live and I’m sure this is why the builders just sectioned it off. The area is the top most point of my roof facing East and one would need to cut into the wood in order to gain access and to what end? I’m thinking I’m going to invest in a CO detector and then if that doesn’t work I’ll check myself into a ward. Thanks again for all the replies and tips!

{"prompt":"18 year old high school senior here. This has been bothering me ever since I realized high school will be over in just a little over a semester.\n\nThroughout high school, I've just been an average kid (on the surface). B student, doing the bare minimum expected of me, etc. Nothing astounding or terrible and I'm just trying to get through high school.\n\nWhen I turned 16, I started working part time for my aunt at her restaurant just as a way to get some spending money for gas and going to high school football games with friends. She didn't pay me conventionally. I have a PayPal through which she would pay me. I was under 18 at the time so the account is in my mom's name, but she doesn't have the password nor any real reason (or so she thinks at least, she's probably forgotten about the account entirely at this point) to monitor it. Also, the account has my email and phone number. Point is, she has no access to the account. (This is probably relevant because it's what I used to acquire my money in the second half of this post.)\n\nI made enough money for gas and the occasional ball game, but not much more than that. When I wanted to upgrade my computer, I began thinking of ways to make some extra cash. My aunt refused to give me a raise and my mom wouldn't let me look for a new job because she didn't want me to \"abandon my aunt\" for another business, why don't you just stop spending your money elsewhere, etc.\n\nDrawing has always been a hobby and a passion of mine. I've been drawing since I was 9 or 10 and I'd say I'm pretty decent at it. So naturally, while brainstorming side-job ideas, I thought of starting an art commission business.\n\nFor the first few months, business wasn't booming. I had told all of my friends and family about it and posted it on my private social media. A few of my relatives commissioned art from me, but in hindsight it was almost certainly out of pity for my lack of business or maybe my mom told them to.\n\nI eventually began posting about my art commissions on public media such as Instagram, Reddit (the account is long gone by now, don't ask.), and...the place where I struck gold...4chan.\n\nThe drought kept up for another month until someone replied to me on a \/b\/ art thread claiming to be interested in a commission. We exchanged Kiks and started talking. When he told me what he wanted me to draw, I found it repulsive and came up with an excuse, saying I don't have experience drawing what he wanted and thanking him for the offer. That was when he offered double the amount of money I initially asked for, offering me a whole 40 bucks.\n\n$40 isn't a lot, but as I was younger, it was about equal to a day at work. So on the one hand, $40. On the other, I did not want to nor did I have any experience in drawing furry porn.\n\nTo summarize the next few days, much to my surprise, the guy liked my work and said his friends did too. He invited me to a Discord server full of people like him, and from there I joined other servers and forums and message boards dedicated to \"that kind of art.\" From then on, the commissions started rolling in, first slowly, then steadily. Once both demand and my skill in drawing that kind of art increased, I started buffing up my prices.\n\nLet me tell you. those sick bastards will pay a lot. a LOT. for those commissions. No shit, the highest commission I ever charged was for $350, and the dude paid it in full. The average price of a commission was around \\~$75-100, with the price increasing for more demanding artwork, technically demanding or mentally demanding. (I didn't tell them about the mentally demanding part, I had to keep up a reputation by pretending to be one of them. Easily the worst part of the job.)\n\nYou may be wondering, why did I continue doing this after I got enough money for that computer upgrade? Well, I was 16-18 and making more money than my previous self could've ever imagined making. Of course I continued the commissions. Besides, after drawing your 50th naked anthropomorphic \"fursona\" (these guys' furry alter egos), you start to get pretty desensitized towards it.\n\nAfter drawing your 150th, or your 200th, however, starts to become a little dehumanizing and mid-life crisis (early-life crisis?) inducing. I finally made the revelation earlier this year that I just can't do this forever. Not only would it probably not be a very secure job forever, but it made me progressively more disgusted by myself.\n\nAaaanyway, in the past few years, I've managed to rack up just under $22,000 in furry art commissions. I'm ready to forget about my past, go to art school, study graphic design, and make a living as an artist in a legitimate way rather than a repugnant way.\n\nMy parents aren't rich, but they are just a little on the wealthy side. They and I have discussed the expenses of college in the past and they have told me that if I were to continue living at home, attend a certain art school which is relatively close to home (and is relatively inexpensive), and get as much financial aide and scholarships as I could, they would be able to cover most of the expenses, but I would probably need a loan of $25,000-30,000 to cover the rest. Assuming I can get accepted into the college (which I think I easily can), with my savings and their savings, and a little bit of being economic, I believe I would be able to attend all 4 years without having to get a loan at all. My main idea was to tell them I won the lottery, but...I don't know. I hate lying and I've been hiding this from them for years. I feel like i just need to come clean with them about it. I have absolutely no idea how they would react.\n\nAll that to ask this. What is the best way to go about this? Should I go through with lying to them? What would be the most believable way to lie to them while keeping their trust and support?\n\nTL;DR: Made bank drawing furry porn in high school. Parents don't know about the money but I want to use it for college. What do?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Currently, my favorite idea is the middle ground of telling them about how I got the money from my commissions while also not going into the detail of my art. I would play it off as if it was a surprise and that's why I didn't tell them earlier. Another idea I like is investing it and getting a loan. Maybe I'll do one or both of these, or perhaps neither. I haven't fully decided yet.\n\nTo those who wish to see my art (furry or otherwise), and to those who say they wish to commission art from me, I'm going to have to regretfully decline your request. I've said too much here, to show my art or give my contact information for a commission would possibly be too identifying. For the same reason, I don't want to reveal the servers or forums I was formerly active on. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just want to be careful. Sorry about that. If you're looking to get into the furry art industry, 4chan art request threads may be your gateway if you're persistent and eventually get lucky.\n\nEDIT 2: Don't worry guys, I will talk to an accountant and pay my taxes. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. That will be my first priority once I talk to my parents.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tell your parents that it’s from selling your art, but don’t mention the furries.

{"prompt":"\nEdit: I Survived an ATTEMPTED Kidnapping... \n\nI need some advice. When I was in middle school, I worked for my dad’s law office every summer as a receptionist\/runner. He would take me to work with him every day and I would work a full day with him. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. One of my jobs was as a runner. Back in the 80’s, there was no email and fax machines were brand new and not every office had them. I had to run errands to banks, other offices, etc. On one of these errands, a nice looking, well-dressed man came up to me and asked me the time. I told him and kept walking. I noticed he was behind me as I walked but at a safe distance.  As I continued on my way, I felt uneasy but thought I was overreacting, especially when I crossed the street and noticed he did not follow. At that point I relaxed and continued on with my errands.\n\nOn the way back to the office, I noticed he was at the spot where I had left him. He was standing with his back to me pretending to look into a shop window. As I walked by, I noticed he started following me again so I picked up my pace. As we got to the corner where I would make the turn to go to my dad’s office, he came up behind me, & picked me up from behind (I was very small...about 5 feet and less than 100 lbs). With one hand he opened the back passenger side door. With the other hand he held me up under my arms and around my neck and tried to put me feet first in the car. I screamed and yelled. There were people just a few feet away at a bus stop. They were just staring then looking away. I realized they weren’t going to help so I put my feet on the door frame and locked my knees and started clawing behind me at his eyes, hair, anything I could grab while screaming my head off. At some point, he dropped me to the ground and ran to the drivers door and sped off. I remember every detail like it was yesterday. His face, his suit, his car. \n\nI got up ran into the office building, up the elevator, into my dad’s conference room full of people and told him what happened. He ran out the office. After that I don’t have much information. We never discussed it again. He told me he “took care of it.”   I never spoke to police. My mom never asked me about it. \n\nAs an adult, I started telling this to occasional friends and my husband. They were horrified. Apparently this wasn’t normal. So I asked my dad questions. He didn’t want to talk about it. I asked if he reported it to police. He said he did but that he told them he would not allow them to question me. He didn’t want me to relive it or traumatize me. He didn’t want me on the news. He was afraid I would become the man’s obsession or something. This was the 80’s when parents were terrified of their kids being on milk cartons. \n\nFast forward over 30 years...I’m obsessed with crime shows, unsolved mysteries, etc. I have spoken to therapists about this event, some friends & family so I have people who I have told the details over the years. I’m watching a show and BAM there is his face. The show never mentions when or where his crimes took place. I Google and they happened when I was in middle school. He lived less than 5 miles from where my attempted kidnapping was. My best friend works for the police department in that city now. She found a detective who was on the force at the time and remembered the case. He confirmed the kind of car he had. \n\nHe is serving multiple life sentences for kidnapping, raping, holding captive young girls and murdering one. My question, should I write to him in prison?\n\nFor so many years, people have doubted my story. My dad passed away 6 years ago. They don’t believe the police would have not gotten involved. When this man was arrested, it was national news. i am sure it must have been plastered all over our local news stations and newspapers. I believe my dad hid it from me because he knew from my description he was my attacker. What would you do? \n\nMy friend, the one in law enforcement says there is no reason to reach out to him because he will just enjoy the chance to be relevant in my life and I will not be able to believe a word he says. She says she is 100% certain he is the man who tried to kidnap me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sorry but why would you ever want to reach out to someone who fantasizes, and got very close to taking and hurting you?

{"prompt":"So my friend had a little girl named Mariana. She doesn’t know who the father is, and whatever. High key she’s always been kind of a shit mom - neglectful and short tempered. But I always thought she loved Mariana\n\nI babysat for Mariana a bit here and there but I wasn’t the only sitter. I came to really like this kid. \n\nShe’s now 4. \n\nEver since January my friend was bragging about her new boyfriend in Atlanta. Late April she messaged me and said “hey, my sitter bailed, can you watch Mary (our nickname for Mariana) from friday to Monday (April 27-30)? I’m going to Atlanta to meet my boyfriend and I can’t bring her.” \n\nI agreed to babysit. She told the school and everything. \n\nSo Friday morning she dropped off a bunch of clothes and a stuffy at my apartment. In hindsight she left way more clothes than was normal, but I didn’t think anything of it. Then she left to catch her plane. \n\nI went and picked up Mariana from school, and took her home (for the record I don’t work, I receive compensation and disability from a work injury that left me with a bad knee). I took her to the park across the street from my building and played with her until dinner time, we cooked dinner together, we cleaned up, watched a movie, and then I read her stories (on my phone, the mother didn’t have books and never read to her). I got her changed and put her to bed on the couch, and I went to sleep. We had a good weekend, we went to the library Saturday for half the day and played at the park, and Sunday was kind of a lazy cuddle day - we did some crafts, put on a movie, and napped all day. \n\nMonday after school the mom was supposed to have come to gotten Mariana by 5. She didn’t show. I spammed her phone with calls and texts and got no answer. \n\nI didn’t know what to do so I just kept doing what I was doing. Tuesday, there was still no contact. Mariana was starting to get upset and asked where mommy was. \n\nWednesday I went to my friend’s house but no one home. I contacted all of our mutual friends but still nothing. \n\nWednesday night was hard. Mariana had a really bad tantrum, crying and screaming for her mommy. It was so bad she didn’t sleep and I had to tell her school she wouldn’t be in. The school, for the record, wasn’t asking questions yet. \n\nFinally I got her to calm down. I told her her mommy got a lil lost on her trip but until she came home I’d take care of her. \n\nShe started to have nightmares about being abandoned and became anxious and clingy. After a week of being woken up by her screaming through the night, I let her sleep with me, which helped tremendously. \n\nSo that lasted 5 days until I bought her a little futon and put it beside my bed, so if she wakes up she can see that I’m still right beside her. \n\nWhen she was delivered to me in April, her clothes smelled iffy, her shoes had holes in the soles and were too small, and I found out she needs glasses. I bought her a whole new wardrobe, new shoes, I taught her how to cook and bake and we’re learning guitar for kids. \n\nShe’s healthier, she looks better (before she looked tired all the time and seemed to just be... not well nourished). She hadn’t touched any soda since she’s been in my care and she eats regular healthy meals.\n\nBut we ran into an issue. I took her to get glasses, and the eye doctor said I couldn’t sign for her or make appointments for her since I wasn’t her legal guardian. The school began asking “where is your friend?” And I have no idea. \n\nI told my mom that I would be going to the police and asking them what to do, but what she told me made me stop.... now it’s been 2 weeks and I know I can’t just keep her but... my mom told me if I went to the police I wouldn’t be able to keep her. They’d take her away and try to find the mom or give her to another relative of hers - Mariana would likely go to my friend’s mom who used to beat her. \n\nWhen I was getting ready to go with Mariana to the police station I burst into tears and I hugged her and I told her I loved her and she said “I wuv you too daddy” without any prompting or that word ever being said around her. \n\nI don’t want to lose her... out of everyone in her life I’m the only one who wanted her. I love her. I want her. \n\nEdit: just to clarify, Mariana’s grandmother and uncle both know I have her. They seem to know where the mother is but they won’t say anything. They don’t care that I’m taking care of her and they have never requested or demanded her. They don’t want her.\n\nWhat do I do? Can I be allowed to adopt her based on the grounds that I’ve been looking after her this long? Or will they take her away? \n\nEdit 2: I’ve decided that I have to do the right thing. I’m going to call the grandmother Monday morning and tell her I want custody. And then no matter what, I’ll call CPS, and apply for emergency custody. I’m not ready to say goodbye. I’m on the brink of a panic attack just thinking of it, I feel sick and I’m sweating. But.... we have laws for a reason, and if I circumvent them to protect Mariana other people can do it to hurt kids. \n\nI’m going to wait until Monday. Tomorrow I’m going to give Mariana the best night of her life. Anything she wants to do or wants to have is hers. \n\nWish me luck.\n\nEdit 3: I sought out help from r\/legaladvice but I don’t think they understand what I’m trying to figure out since almost all of their comments are about race. But yeah, I will reach out to CPS and explain that I have spent months trying to get in touch with Mariana’s legal guardian, that I have been her surrogate parent since April, and that Mariana had benefited from my care. I’ll try to explain that I would like to be granted temporary custody until this is figured out since separating us could be traumatizing for Mariana. Thank you all for your advice and kind comments. \n\nEdit 4: since it seemed to upset a lot of people I deleted some information about how no one knows Mariana’s cultural identity. It’s not really relevant anyways as my concerns that culture could influence CPS’s decisions is apparently unfounded. I’m happy that CPS doesn’t see colour or culture but I hope that in doing so, they don’t mistakenly put children in the homes of people who are disrespectful towards their heritage. \n\nEdit 5: I just got off the phone with Mariana’s grandmother. It didn’t go well. She was quite offended when I said I had already called CPS, and she was even more offended that I want to adopt Mariana. She insinuated that I am trying to hurt the mother because I’m jealous that she won’t sleep with me. While Mariana’s mother is a pretty woman, our personalities are at conflict and despite my crippling loneliness I am not interested in engaging in those activities with her. The exchange became heated as she focused on my weight and lack of sexual prowess and I focused on Mariana’s wellbeing and my desire to give her a good home. \n\nI’ll make a new update post once everything has settled down. CPS should have someone here by 4:30. \n\nEdit 6: I can’t really message 200 people so I’ll just post this here and whoever sees it sees it. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/8uljpa\/in_april_a_friend_dropped_her_daughter_off_with\/\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In most states, this is abandonment by the mother who is therefore automatically seen an an unfit parent in the eyes of the law.

CPS first and foremost and tell them everything you’ve been providing for the child.

{"prompt":"I (F19) and my cousin who I'll call D (M19) are strictly no contact and I actually refused to acknowledge his existence for a long time until suddenly I kept getting nightmares and panic attacks remembering what he did to me. (This gets a bit graphic)\n\nAround the age of 12 to 13, he came into my grandma's room took out his phone with the flash took out his penis right in front of me, and said \"touch it\" and to \"put it in your mouth\". I was completely freaked out backed up and only could say no. For the next 2 minutes, he kept trying to convince me \"it's finnnne\" or \"I won't show anyone\" and how if I don't do it he'll get me to do it. I was terrified and with my other older cousin being the only other person at the house, but unfortunately outside I was alone. I told him again no and got out as fast as I could, but he was following me. His penis is out and he is following me with his camera the whole time. I start running around the house and he's full-on chasing me at this point and I'm crying begging him to stop. I somehow figured out during all of this he wouldn't come outside where neighbors and my other older cousin could see so I ran to the front door and got out and he stopped chasing me finally.\n\nOn multiple other occasions, I would be laying down and be pretending to sleep and he would pretend to give me back rubs when other people would come in the room, but the moment they left he would grope me nonstop unless I faked sleep movements. I assume he was scared I would \"wake up\" during his weird sessions. Many times during the day he would try kissing me and forcing me to make out with him, but I always fought it which would make him chase me until I would cry or scream which made him stop eventually. Finally, it all stopped when I was too uncomfortable around him and had an extreme depressive episode so I never really saw them as much. I would see my cousins and aunt because they technically didn't do anything, but the moment he was in the room I left or I would sit silently in the corner.\n\nI unfortunately had a suicide attempt at 17 which is when I told everyone finally what happened and what he did to me. His mother (aunt) called me delusional and threatened a restraining order telling me I made it all up for attention. I went off on her telling her everything and immediately cutting contact with her and anyone else who decided I was lying. I didn't think it was worth it to give them a big fight I just wanted them gone. I loved my other cousins and aunt I genuinely didn't think she'd immediately blame me, but it is what it is.\n\nSadly another girl came forward not too long ago claiming he raped and assaulted her and my aunt told her the same thing she told me. Threatening her and saying how she is only saying the assault happened because he's successful and she wants to ruin his career. The girl who made the claims dropped it and refused to make contact with them just like I did.\n\nIt sucks knowing how popular he is now and seeing all of his fans while I am just in my room thinking about what he did to me and what another possible victim is saying.

{"prompt":"I'm 22M, she is 23F\n\n3 years ago I unexpectedly met my current girlfriend during a camping trip and we got to know each other very quickly and started talking and going on dates. She seemed like the most perfect girl ever, often mentioning that no one gives her a chance because she looks muscular\/big (she used to spend most of her free time in the gym until the pandemic)\n\nAbout a year later I moved in to her house after her parents gave it to her. When I moved in everything was fine but she slowly started to isolate me from my family and friends without me really realizing. Afterwards she started to sort of physically abuse me: pushing me a bit, lightly dragging me somewhere. At first I didn't mind it too much but over the 2 years living with her the abuse has gotten worse and worse each day, it feels like I have marks and bruises on my body permanently.\n\nThree days ago she struck me in the ribs with a chair so hard that I thought some were actually broken. I finally decided to call the police and an ambulance. They arrived and the paramedics barely checked me out and told me and the police that my ribs were fine, so the officers thought that I'm lying. I showed the officers my other bruises but my girlfriend made some story that I'm a drunk and fight with others and they believed her and just left.\n\nSince then the abuse has gotten worse. Its horrible. I don't know what to do because people don't seem to believe me, don't know how or who to ask for help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe look into some shelters for abused people?

All of this is about enriching the kid's environment. That make be the single most important thing that you can do.\n\nEat healthy. Breastfeeding is better if possible: nutritionally, for brain development, for immunity (antibodies in breast milk). Read Nurtureshock. Read another parenting book. If you smoke, quit. \n\nTeach your kid a foreign language early if you can. Any five year old can learn Chinese in a year. Any fifteen year old would who doesn't speak a similar language will struggle.\n\nGet the child music lessons and exercise. Screen time may not be harmful but it crowds out things that are beneficial.\n\nHave a weekly date night if you can. Make it really hard to cancel.\n\nYou can teach a baby to read. It's sort of fun.

I'm not heartless. My dad doesn't have the space, time, money, or mental capacity to be raising a kid either. So it falls to me. I've agreed to take this kid in.

Today I was having some stomach issues so I came home around 1pm and as I walked into my apartment I heard male and female moans and a bed creaking. I immediately bolted into my daughters room and saw the neighbor on top of her. They had a blanket over them so I was spared from seeing what would have been a much more disgusting and disgraceful scene. When they noticed me they were scared out of their wits. I grabbed the neighbor by his neck and threw him out of my apartment and slammed the door shut to have the talk of a lifetime with my daughter. She initially was silent and refused to talk but after a few hours she answered some of my questions. Assuming she was being honest, I found out that she started this  “affair” by seducing the neighbor because she thought he was attractive, that the said “affair” has been going on since April, and that she really believed it was her fault and did not want to press charges against him. I wanted to sue him on charges of statutory rape, but much to my dismay the age of consent is 16 in the New Jersey so that is not an option. What other legal options can I pursue against my neighbor and should I take my daughter to a child psychiatrist? Thank you all.\n\nEdit: So I did call the cops and when they came they separately questioned me, my daughter, and the neighbor. After the questioning they told the that the most I could do is change apartments and get a restraining order against him for my daughter because based on what my daughter told them it seemed as if there was no coercion (apparently my daughter was actually defending him). Weirdly enough she also got angry at me and told me to just mind my own business and stop getting involved in hers. However I am starting to suspect that he might have brainwashed her over the past 8 months or that he might have some sort of “dirt” on her.

When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. END"}
{"prompt":"my boyfriend has a fever of 103.2, can barely leave the bed, pounding headache, cough, chest tightness and the hospital discharged him fairly quickly saying it’s “presumptive corona” and he should just take tylenol and rest. they denied him the test for the virus! they said it’s because of his age (23) and that he has no underlying health conditions (that he knows of) he is usually an extremely energetic, talkative guy and now he can barely keep his head up or move. I’ve seen him sick before, and he was still 75% his self - this drastic change in his behavior and functioning is scaring me. I have never seen him this badly sick. I know that he’s young, and there’s a great chance he will be okay. But seeing more and more young people dying in the news is so so worrisome. I just fear the hospital wasn’t careful with him because they were so eager to get him out. I’m worried something bad might happen\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Emt student here so don’t take my word as law, but, Covid is a virus so testing it would only confirm he has a virus and there isn’t any cure. Hospital care is primarily assistive I.e. giving fluids. If he starts having breathing issues IMMEDIATELY take him to the doctor (if he can’t breathe then they can put him on oxygen which is the only care that hospitals can give for viruses that most people can’t do from home) but until then you’re actually better off caring for him yourself. (Less chance of getting other illnesses, personalised more comfortable care that’s more attentive) Gatorade is a great way to stay hydrated and keep your electrolytes up when you’re throwing up or losing fluids out the other end. If he can’t tolerate a higher fever you can use a painkiller to help but a fever is actually what causes the virus to die so if he can handle the heat, let him as much as possible. That being said there are some serious concerns raised about using NSAIDs such as ibuprofen on covid patients so Tylenol or aspirin (if his blood coagulates regularly) are your best bet for painkillers\/fever lowerers. Other than that make sure he’s drinking water\/Gatorade. Eating food (remember bats: bananas, apple sauce, toast, soft foods) and sleeping as much as possible. \nIn short: the hospital was right to discharge him; he’ll heal better at home for cheaper (if given above treatment) and a high fever is just a good sign of a healthy immune system that’s fighting off a virus. If he starts to have breathing issues, then you should go back to the hospital.\nAs for preventative measures, make sure you’re cleaning as much as possible especially in areas you share the most, bathrooms, sinks, anything your hands touch regularly. If you have them, gloves are great, if not wash your hands as much as possible (you should be doing that anyway tho). Masks are the most helpful thing. If you dont have a mask, layering up bandanas is better than nothing but a bra is also a good filter and I’m guessing you have those so if you don’t have a mask, wear a bra on your face even though it probably feels supremely silly. Don’t go to the store during busy hours if you can help it and wear a mask or cover at the store in case you cough because you very well could be asymptotic right now.\nEDIT: I forgot to mention how important it is to *keep hydrated*. I literally cannot stress this enough. There is a type of shock (called hypovolemia) you can get from fluid depletion and if you’re vomiting from both ends there is a chance you can lose too much fluid and go into shock. Usually this is caused by blood loss but with extreme vomiting from either or both ends (I really hate the word Diarrhea so, vomiting from the bottom is how I say it) you can actually go into the same type of shock. So STAY HYDRATED!\nEdit: a lot of sources are saying that NSAIDs are actually okay, I hadn’t checked in a while so idk what to do with that but most of the concerns about NSAIDs appear to be just a coincidence at this point. Is probably safe to take them if you need to, that being said don’t lower the fever too much or your body won’t be able to fight the virus. END"}

{"prompt":"It all just seems so stupidly unreal. I feel too normal to have a brain tumor. I’m only 25, and I have no idea how I’m gonna tell people. How do I get through this? How do I even cope? My entire life just got shattered. At the doctor they took away my drivers license because I’m a seizure risk, and told me they’ll call me later today to schedule my massive and complex surgery for sometime this week. How do I react to all this? I don’t even know what emotions I’m supposed to feel. I’m supposed to be at work right now, but instead I’m scheduling my extended medical leave even though I feel no different than I did yesterday. Has anyone else gone through this? It seems like the kind of thing you only see on medical dramas. And doctors are using scary words like “metastasis” and “survival rate” and “prognosis”. I’m so fucking scared. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" I was diagnosed with a brain tumor at a really young age. Here is my take:\n\nYou need to try your best to relax, keep yourself occupied, try not think about the details. That's the best thing you can do for yourself right now.\n\nSecondly, medical technology has come a long way. I was diagnosed in the 90's, and in South Africa (so not top-tier medical services at this stage). They weren't entirely sure what caused it or what the best step. Long story short, I turned out just fine and even without surgery. Fast forward 20 odd years, and these things are less problematic, they're better understood, and treatment is far better. Recovery times are much quicker and chances for complications are lower, especially if you're in a country with good medical care.\n\nDon't drive, this could endanger others.\n\nHere's what I suggest you do:\n\n* Ask your doctor what type of tumor they think it is (Determine if it's malignant or not (it's usually not))\n* Ask about treatment. How to prepare for the surgery, what is the expected recovery time? and so on\n* If you're not 100% happy with your doctor, ask for a referring for a second opinion.\n* Put the medical dramas out of your mind. They're often focused on rare and unlikely scenarios, freak accidents, and overhyped\/exaggerated with the medical jargon. You don't need that.\n* Inform family, and closest friends\n* Be prepared to stock up on movies\/series\/games etc. for your recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it seems daunting, but you're likely in the care of experienced hands who have done these procedures many times.

I say this as someone who comes from a toxic family, sometimes parents don’t always know whats best. Don’t worry about finding a new gf now, give yourself time to heal from all this while enjoying college. It’ll take awhile but eventually you’ll meet new people, form your own support system and slowly begin to feel better about yourself. But the wound is still fresh, and unfortunately those crappy feelings won’t leave overnight. I hate to say it but with shit like this the only way out is through.

{"prompt":"So I(M) just got engaged to my girlfriend of almost 5 years.\n\nBit of a backstory, I have a brother (2 years older than me) that suffers with severe cerebral palsy due to complications at birth that resulted in a hemispherectomy procedure (where half the brain is removed). He has about the mental age of a toddler, but is none the wiser and is happier than the average person. He requires 24\/7 care from my parents and additional support. No fault of his own, he is very vocal and loud. My parents life revolve around him 360 degrees and I always come 2nd. Fair enough.\n\nMy problem here started when I told my mother about wanting to ask my girlfriend to marry me and her first response was “Will the venue be disable accessible?” No congratulations, no tears, just concern about my brothers access.\n\nAfter proposing, the worries started to come. If we invite my parents and brother to the wedding, is the wedding going to revolve around my brother and his comfort and are they going to completely ignore me?\n\nThe selfish part of me wants to invite them bar my brother because I don’t want to be sidelined on such an important day, if not the most important day of my life. (side note: they never attended my University graduation even though I asked months in advance and the excuse was they had to look after my brother).\n\nI’ve came to the conclusion that I do not want my brother there anyway due to his vocal nature; he would be a very big distraction during such an intimate moment. I love my brother, it’s not personal, I just don’t want to be thinking about that during our special day. Plus he would be none the wiser to his surroundings.\n\n**My question here is**: how could I possible approach my parents about this issue without offending them?\n\nMy fiancé has concerns that when I talk to my parents, it will feel like this is coming from her and not me, possibly making her out to be the bad guy when this is 100% my worries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you to all that replied, I will respond to each tomorrow but for now, I feel the need to clarify a few details:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I planned on having a destination wedding with only us and a friend to officiate obviously not including witnesses but since COVID-19, travelling abroad just isnt possible to even plan as of now.\n\nWe have resorted to planning an inland wedding with a max capacity at the ceremony of 12 people. It is a very small gathering for us as we have an intamate circle of friends and family despite having extended family. My brothers presence would duly be recognised due to the small scale of the wedding.\n\nMy brother is also wheelchair bound and has many physical restrictions and due to this, finding a venue that isn't a social club just isnt possible. My parents have access to additional care, however, a respite home is out of the question due to abuse taking place in those institutions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" To be completely honest based on their absence from your graduation this is likely a no win scenario for you.

She literally packed her shit and went while I was at work, just left behind a note saying she'd been cheating for a year and had moved across the country to be with the new dude.

He rejects me on those nights because he wants mummy and her special song to soothe him and it isn't the same when I sing it. Twice he has gotten so worked up following a nightmare and asking for her that he's thrown up. There are days where he will literally sit for hours in our window watching our building's car park waiting for her to pull in.

He has **SAID** this.\n\n* He's made it clear he knows we have animals strictly due to the fact he said \"I came over and knocked but didnt hear any dogs, thought maybe you took them to the park or something\" - My sister and I are home more than average for people our age and havent heard him knock or seen him around outside of the times ive mentioned it here.\n\n* Somehow he knows when my mom *is* home BUT never comes and asks her these questions. He approaches my SISTER about questions referring to my mother.\n\n\nNow the most recent thing was **TODAY**:\n\nMy sister was laying outside on our deck tanning and he came from behind our house(*this isnt creepy in terms of where we live, all the houses are very close and we all share a field behind each home*) and started a conversation with her. The conversation was along the lines of this:\n\n(H = Him,  S = My sister)\n\n**Him:** \"Your mom doesnt really have a boyfriend does she?\"\n\n**Sister:** \"She does\"\n\n**H:** \"How come I never see him?\"\n\n**S:** \"He parks up the street since our two cars take up the driveway\"\n\n**H:** *Continues being skeptical and basically arguing and interrogating my sister*\n\n\n\nWith that conversation alone, he's making it clear that he's keeping an eye on us in some way. \nAfter my mom heard this conversation, she called the police and asked them to tell him to make it clear shes uninterested - since he's not listening to my mom.\n\n\nThey went to talk to him and we could HEAR HIM YELLING from 2-3 doors down when talking to the police. Why is **he** yelling while the police are telling him to stay away? They were arguing from somewhat of a distance in the middle of the road.\n\n\nThe cops afterward came back and even mentioned \"he's a creepy ass dude\" when referring to the guy. They said they made it clear that my mom is uninterested but if anything happens again, call immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing how he reacted, I am fully prepared for shit to go down. I do not think this is just a guy who will go away after this.\nHe is purposely coming around when he assumes im not around and being extremely weird.\n\n\n\nI will probably get comments saying \"*its not worth it*\" but I dont want my family to get hurt or even murdered and then live with the idea of \"man i shouldve did this or that\". (Note im not going to just go out and assault this guy for no reason, will fall under self-defense but i really do not feel like itll just be a fight - i feel like weapons may end up being involved.) This is why the title may seem a little dramatic. A normal fist fight isnt anything to fear or really prepare for, im almost *expecting* it to be much worse.\n\n\n\nI am very on edge and would like any advice that could be given.\nWe have a camera set up outside BECAUSE OF THIS GUY and we are waiting for my sister to come home so I can walk her inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n—— \n**(edit - June 1st)** \n\nWasn’t expecting this to blow up.\nI won’t be able to read or reply to every comment so I feel the need to add a few notes:\n\n\n* I am in no way intending on harming this person. This is not a threat or a plan. I’m simply preparing incase it does reach an extreme level.\n\n\n\n* We do have one small outdoor camera, it snaps a picture every time there’s any movement around it and it sends directly to our (my sis, mom and I) phones. We plan on getting a second.\n\n\n\n* We plan on getting a gun and a few baseball bats. My mom and sister both have pepper spray.\n\n\n* We can’t move or stay with anyone due to the amount of pets we have and low income as my mom is the only source of income. My mom however is very scared and keeps bringing up the fact she wants to move.\n\n\n* While everything in the past has been odd and there’s a bunch of warning signs, there *is* a small chance that nothing else will happen and he’ll leave us alone. He hasn’t come off as aggressive or perverted. However we know not to let our guard down.\n\n\n\nI will be sure to update\/do a follow up if anything else does happen.\n\n\n\nThank you all for your replies and well wishes. Hopefully you guys are being safe as well with how much is going on in the world.\n\n——\n\n**Update**\n(June 2nd)\n\n\nWe tried to get a peace order and got denied. Not enough evidence.\n\nAfter everyone got some sleep and was levelheaded, my mom decided she does not want a gun in the home.\n\n\n\nToday while my mom and sister were at their car, they saw the guy looking from his driveway\/truck and when they(my fam) looked over, he put his head down. Might seem weird but I see that as a good sign.\n\n\nWe’re much more calm now after getting some sleep but we’re making sure we don’t let our guard down.\n\n\nMy mom and my sister both got pepper spray and we will be getting some baseball bats.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Be prepared to call the cops at all times and ask them what could fall under self defence if you are obligated to engage.

{"prompt":"As the title states, my nieces (1 and 2) and nephew (5) are in my care now. They are all mixed race, half white from their mother (my sister) and their bio father is half African American and half Latino. Just so everyone can get a more clear picture, all of them have tanned skin with super curly brown hair and eyes. All of my family is lily white with straight blonde hair so I am not fully confident in my ability to pick out the right products they need to manage any hair and\/or skin concerns or what they might be. They could pass as being of fully Latin descent or simply a tanned white person, but I do believe it is important they grow up knowing all of their heritage and embracing all aspects of who they are. It’s not something I want to ignore.\n\nI have made it my mission to educate myself so I am able to help them down the road. However, I do not have any experience whatsoever in this arena so I need some help with learning how to care for their hair and skin\/what products to use as well as the more emotional side of things, like the struggles they will have and how to best communicate with them. Any reading materials\/videos or suggestions for hair care or skin care would be great. Any advice would also be appreciated. \n\nI hope I didn’t offend anyone, I am just trying to do the best I can. My sister and her husband both died and I was the only family member on either side that was willing and able to take them in. I did NOT want them to go to foster care.

His father is African American and was born and raised in Louisiana. After reading some comments, I searched online and I’d say all of the kids have the 3A hair type and it is dark brown. I also have found out they need to wear sunscreen. Should it be the highest SPF, like the kind I use? Or does it need to be lower because they have more melanin than I do? I’m actually a first grade teacher so I am around a variety of children and have gone through culture sensitivity training and such, but I have not had to provide full time care for children who have different physical features than me so I really appreciate the help I am getting.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A few things.

{"prompt":"*EDIT*: I got a lot more replies than expected and I’ve tried to read through as many as I can. I first want to thank everyone who gave their advice. While some of it did sting to read (the ones calling me a shallow asshole) honestly, it needed to be said. I really do regret the way I worded some things in this post and I admit it was immature of me to only talk about her looks and not her health. I promise I am deeply concerned about her health as well, I admittedly was not in the best mood when I wrote this, as I was feeling very frustrated.\n\nAfter reading through some replies, I am definitely going to make sure at some point she sees a doctor. Reading a lot of these possible health conditions she might have scares me and I want to make sure we get that figured out as soon as possible.\n\nThe second thing is I take full responsibility I’m not doing my part with the healthy meals and exercise either. I would actually like to thank the comments mentioning that because it was something I did not even consider and needed to be made aware of. I am for sure going to take action and stop with the fast food because that is just as much my fault as it is hers. You guys are right, it is a team effort and I can’t expect her to eat healthy if I’m not willing to do the same. I also plan to step up and be more involved in the child care (watching the baby more so that she has time to exercise or just time for herself). It also helps that her mom is pretty involved too and I know she’d be more than happy to watch the baby for us too if we need it.\n\nThird, I just want to clarify that I have never (and will never) called my wife fat, told her that’s she’s repulsive, etc. I would never actually SAY these things to her, I know better than that and I would never want to hurt her. I have never mocked or ridiculed her for her weight.\n\nFourth, to the people saying that I don’t really love her or that I’m being abusive, I am going to have to respectfully disagree with you there. I admit I sounded really shallow in my post and like a complete ass and could definitely have worded it better, but I’d like to make clear that I absolutely love and am in love with my wife. Her wonderful personality hasn’t changed since getting married and she has gone above and beyond as a mother. I wouldn’t want anyone else to be the mother of my son. Aside from the weight issue, we honestly haven’t really had any other major problems in our marriage. We get along really well and enjoy each other’s company. I have no regrets marrying her, even with the weight gain. Of course I do hope she loses some weight but I’m in no way feeling regretful about getting married to her.\n\nAnd this brings me to my last point- I’m not going to divorce her. I saw a couple comments saying my marriage is destined to fail but I don’t think so. I’m not going to just throw in the towel that easy and walk out on our marriage and on our son. As I said earlier, I still love her very much and I wanna be there for her in sickness and in health. Yes we are religious too and we have both talked about and agreed on the fact that we would never divorce unless it was something TRULY worth divorcing over (abuse, drugs, infidelity, etc). \n\nAgain, thanks for the replies everyone and this has really led me to step back and consider my part in all of this too. I’m feeling more hopeful after reading these replies and think that I have some good starting points to go from here (seeing a doctor to make sure this isn’t a more serious issue for example being one of them). Thanks again everyone!\n\n*ORIGINAL POST*:\n\n22M here. My wife (also 22) and I both got married when we were 18. She used to be 125 pounds at 5’6. She was incredibly fit, had the most perfect body ever and even had abs. We had our beautiful son 2 years ago and she put on a ton of weight during her pregnancy. I know that obviously you’re supposed to put on weight when you’re pregnant but she put on way more than was normal. I thought maybe it would go away after the baby but it hasn’t. She just keeps gaining.\n\nShe is still 5’6 but now weighs 215 pounds. I know this sounds mean but she is HUGE. I don’t even recognize her anymore. I feel physically repulsed looking at her body and sex is awful now with her because I just can’t get turned on. I feel terrible even typing this out but it’s the truth. I haven’t really told her how I felt, but she knows she is big and has tried multiple times to lose weight. She always gives up after a couple weeks and goes back to her old ways.\n\nThe closest she ever got was losing 3 pounds. Not joking. Then she gave up and gained it back plus more. I still love her deeply, she is my wife and I love our family. But I can’t keep feeling like this in our marriage. How do I approach the topic of her weight with her without hurting her feelings? \n\nAnd by the way, I’m not even considering a divorce. That isn’t and will never be an option for me. But I really do want her to lose weight otherwise I don’t know what I’m going to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe get her thyroid checked out?

{"prompt":"I’m sort of at a loss with this. To start off, I’m 25 and my brother is 20. Our dad passed away a year ago and my brother had a really hard time with it. He eventually withdrew from college and moved back home to get his head straightened out. I was home visiting this weekend and everything seemed normal. We hung out, went out to lunch, my brother and I saw a movie together, we caught up, the usual family stuff. My mom converted my old bedroom into a home office, so I was sleeping in the guest room in the basement.\n\nLast night, after everyone went to bed, I snuck out back and blazed up. Don’t judge me. I’m not a pothead, but it helps me to relax sometimes. I came inside, watched tv, and around midnight was stupidly hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack.\n\nWhile I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard someone yell something upstairs but it was muffled. I went to the base of the stairs and listened and I heard was I’m positive were sex noises from upstairs. I didn’t think my mom or bro was seeing anyone and I definitely didn’t thin anyone came to the house after I went downstairs. I was mostly just curious so I crept up the stairs a little and I could hear one of the voices was my mom for sure. I assumed it was just a booty call and maybe someone snuck in while I was downstairs. I went back to the kitchen, warmed up some pizza in the toaster oven and was eating it at the counter when I heard a door open and close upstairs, followed by footsteps, and then another door closing. Again, curious, so I went upstairs and went to my bro’s room to see if he was awake and knew what was going on. His light was on so I knocked lightly and he answered the door in boxers and looking sweaty. He sort of jumped when he saw it was me, like he wasn’t expecting it. He asked what’s up and I said I thought I heard some noises up here and wondered if he had too. He got super sketchy and blushed and said he hadn’t heard anything. I was super suspicious now and also felt super awkward bc it sorta seemed like maybe he had been involved in making those noises. I felt really embarrassed and weird and I basically gtfo of there and went downstairs.\n\nI couldn’t sleep that night and today at breakfast things were way awkward with me and him and mom. Maybe I’m being paranoid, I was smoking last night, but it feels like maybe they’re having sex and I caught them. I don’t know if I’m crazy and there’s another explanation or if I should say something. Part of me thinks if they are doing it they’re both adults, but idk, it’s got a major squick factor to it and I’m sorta at a loss. Do folks think I’m just being paranoid and, if not, should I say something?\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned that I’m a female. Dunno that it makes a huge difference but Some people assumed I was a guy.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\n\nStill figuring out what comes next, but I got so much advice and so many responses last time I wanted to update you all. Last night, I pretended that I was going out for dinner and drinks with friends and said I wouldn’t be home until late. I drove around the block, parked, and snuck back into the basement. And then I waited and listened.\n\nI heard the tv on and my mom and bro talking. I couldn’t really make out what they were saying. Around 9 o’clock they went upstairs. Once I was sure they were both upstairs I snuck up and listened at the base of the stairs (around the corner from the bottom so no one would see me). I felt like a nut but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about all the what ifs. I heard voices from my mom’s room; again too soft to make out. After maybe 20 mins I heard a moan. I crept up the stairs and when I was at the top I could hear what were distinctly sex noises from moms room.\n\nI crept down the hall to see if my bro was in his room, pushed the door open, and stuck my head in. At this point, I didn’t care if he asked me what I was doing home, I figured if he was in there I’d just tell him I came home early and wanted to hang out or something. But it didn’t really matter. It was empty.\n\nI went back down the hall and listened at mom’s door. It was mostly quiet, the sound of the bed, a few grunts, but I distinctly heard mom saying oh fuck a few times. After a few minutes they clearly had climaxed, somewhat loudly, and the noises stopped and I heard my brother’s voice. He said he was going to take a quick shower. Then mom said she’d join him.\n\nI was and am in a daze. I don’t think there’s any doubt that they are having sex. I went back to the basement and I’ve been lying here thinking for the last few hours. I haven’t said anything to either of them. Part of me wants to burst in on them, part of me wants to confront my bro, I don’t really want to talk to my mom.\n\nIt’s a really weird position to be in.

{"prompt":"(idk if this is nsfw but tagged just to be safe) \n\n(F17)\n\nI discovered I had a septate hymen about a year ago when I first (successfully) put a tampon in. Long story short, when I went to go take it out, it wouldn’t budge, so I took a mirror and discovered that a piece of tissue or something was straddling the entrance to my vagina. I eventually got it out myself by pushing the tissue to the side, which was a little painful\/uncomfortable. I looked it up and I undeniably have a septate hymen. Basically what this means is that I can’t use tampons or have sex (technically I could but it would be painful and in my case I think nothing larger than a tampon could go in). It can be fixed with a minor surgery. \n\nIt took me months to tell anyone about this, and today I finally told my mom. I was expecting her to be concerned and look up what it is and stuff but she just said “you are not getting surgery just to use a tampon” and ended the conversation. \n\nI also have a boyfriend (haven’t seen him in forever cause of corona but we FaceTime everyday) and we’ve talked about sex and I’m so afraid to disappoint him when he finds out that we probably can’t do it. \n\nI think next time I go to the doctor for yearly checkup I will ask about it but my mom never leaves the room and I never ask her to leave because I don’t want her to think I’m hiding anything.\n\nI feel like I’m wearing a chastity belt and I feel alone in this. I’m too embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. Should I try and push this issue with her? I just don’t want this to be the only thing holding me back from having a normal sex life in the future and I just want to use tampons.\n\nEDIT: Wow thanks everyone for so many responses and the kind words! I hesitated to turn to the internet for advice but this was extremely helpful. I feel like my feelings have been validated and that this is something that I need to get taken care of ;-;. And thank you to those who opened up about their personal experiences with this. I will definitely bring this up with my mom again and talk to a doctor the first chance I get. Btw my mom is on reddit so hopefully she never comes across this post :\/ 😭\n\nEDIT 2: it’s the next day and I have read all of your comments and they’ve been so helpful! I just asked her when my next doctors appointment will be so I can ask about it but she said they aren’t taking appointments right now. I kept pressing and saying that it can cause problems other than not being able to wear tampons but she kept brushing it off saying that I probably don’t even have it. After telling her that I was almost certain I had it (and if I don’t then something else is wrong) she told me to wait until I see a gynecologist 😭. I have no idea when she would take me to one but I’m pretty sure not anytime soon. I’m going to keep asking and voicing my concerns because I think the main problem is that she doesn’t think it’s an important issue right now.\n\nLast update: I kept expressing my concern to her today and explained the issue further and she’s gonna call the gynecologist on Monday 😭Thanks for all the help, I probably would’ve just given up after yesterday but these comments really motivated me to take care of this 🙏🏼.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I had this as well and I am also your age.

When I went, I told my doctor about it and she looked at it during the appointment before referring me to a gynaecologist. I had to wait for about two months for my appointment but the “surgery” only took about 10 minutes.

{"prompt":"My sister is an 8th grader in middle school. Her bus arrives for school at 8:30 every morning. My mom leaves at 7:30 A.M. to go to work and I leave at 8:00 A.M. to go to college. We set countless alarms for her to wake up to, and we try to wake her up before we leave. My mother sets an alarm in her room and three alarms on my sisters phone. I am getting ready to leave when the first alarm goes off. My sister always walks to my mothers room, which is a good 20-30 feet away from her own,turns off the alarm and cozies up in her own bed. She has missed consecutive whole weeks of school, and I estimate she's missed about two to three weeks per nine weeks. My mom just got a new job after working ten years for the same company, she's on a 1 year probation period where the slightest mistake can get her terminated. My sister has missed so many days of school that my mother could possibly be fined or arrested. All my sister has to do is wake up, get dressed and catch the school bus, but she is too lazy to get up. We try finding alternatives for if she misses the bus, such as taking the city bus, but she is too spoiled to try and learn. Everytime I try to show her the route, she defies me and lashes out.\n\n\nI'm fucking sick of her, she talks back to our mom who tries to be gentle and calm with her, and she has the biggest fits over the slightest things. Our father travels around the country either working for a short period or sitting in jail. My sister is so unbelievably spoiled and she doesn't understand the consequences her actions have. She does awful in school, and my mother tries to punish her, taking her phone away, taking the TV cord, etc. But she either finds some way around her punishment, or she throws a fit. The only punishment she doesn't recieve is a spanking.\n\n\n Today was the last straw, I had food poisoning, so I was able to stay home. I made sure to wake her up and then I got caught up for about ten minutes in the bathroom. After getting off the toilet, I walk to her room to see her wrapped up under her covers. After missing a whole week of school for a \"leg injury\", she didn't get up today because she was \"too sleepy\". It would be one thing if she was stressed or overworked, but she clearly isn't, she never studies, does her homework, and she has an unhealthy obsession with discord (she doesn't even play games, she is just obsessed with whatever goes on in there). I immediately call my mom, who tearfully tries to plead with my sister to get up. All my sister responds with is a faint \"i'm sleepy\". She hands the phone back to me. I hear my mom sobbing over the phone, the last time I heard her cry was in 2007 when she broke up with my dad. I snapped and ripped the covers off my sisters bed and threw her in the shower and turned it on. I don't have a drivers license so I had to call an uber for her and she's currently off to school. \n\n\nMy mom can't pay for an uber everytime she wakes up late, and I had to use my scholarship money to pay for this. With how bad my sister does in school she might get held back. When I was in middle school, on top of having to wake myself up, I had to wake up a good hour before 8:00 A.M. if I wanted to make it to school and socialize with my friends before class started. It was a good 50 minute walk every weekday for three years, and if I didn't want to walk I had to wake up extra early, around 5:00 a.m, if I wanted my mom to drive me there. My sister is privellaged enough to get a school bus to come to our house which is outside the zone for the school she is going to, and she doesn't utilize it. If my mom were to get arrested or fined for my sisters' truancy she could lose her job, which is ridiculous. If my sister can make it past 8th grade, she will be in high school, and will need to wake up earlier than me and my mom, so we'll be home to wake her up. But with how things are going, I'm afraid she'll either be held back, or my mom might lose her job. At the very least, is there any way to absolve my mother of any consequences that are related to my sister's truancy?\n\nEDIT: I'm her brother\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all for your responses. Before I made this thread I suggested that my mom schedule an appointment with a therapist. We got an appointed scheduled with a doctor on the 6th that will suggest if my sister needs therapy or not. All of your responses have been extremely helpful. I was given a link to an article I shared with my sister to read and I sent the CINS\/PINS Pdf to my mom so she could read it. I'm currently waiting for a response.\n\nEDIT 3: I know it seems like i'm making excuses for some of the answers in the comment, but you have to understand that my mom has financially and emotionally supported two children by herself over the past 18 years. We have tried being aggressive with my sister, even to the point of just throwing her outside her room. She will go limp and completely refuse all compliance. We have taken every source of entertainment out of her room, it enables her to think it's fine to miss school as long as she loses something. Some of these options do not work for how stuborn she is. She is a 14 year old, and has reached a point in her maturity where she could be considered a young woman. My mother seriously works her hardest to try to get through to my sister, she does not deserve to get her home, job, and life stripped from her over the actions of a stubborn 14 year old not going to school.\n\n\nEDIT 4: Probation doesn't mean my mom got in trouble with the law or her work, she's never been arrested in her life or faced a criminal charge. It just means she's new at work and any mistake could cost her job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I had this situation happen with my siblings and then years later a friends sibling. When I was growing up this wasn’t an option but later on with my friends sister her parents were actually able to report her to the state.

It wasn’t too bad because she just started going to school but I’m sure it can be if the kid doesn’t. \n\nThey reported her, they had an interview and she received a court date. During the court appearance the judge puts her on a type of REAL probation program and the consequence is you go to school or you become a ward of the state\/report to training school. I can’t remember all of the details but it’s scary if the kid doesn’t respond right. \n\nThe parents were petrified she would act up and face these consequences so I don’t know if it’s the best recommendation but it might be worth seeing if your state has anything similar?

He also had an ear infection that I begged my mom to take care of but she kept insisting it would go away on it’s own. He also needed a better tank and a better filter but my mom thought it was too big of a problem to fix. Basically, she didn’t want to take care of him and cover the costs. It’s not like we couldn’t afford it, it’s that she felt like she’d be “wasting” money on a turtle. The fact that she just threw him out without telling me makes me furious. I could’ve gotten a job and paid for the expenses myself. She joked about throwing him in a pond ONCE, I didn’t think she’d actually do it. I had an emotional attachment to him and I miss him.

I don’t know if anybody remembers those “Grow a Frog” kits you could order way back in the day. They would mail you the little kit with a tiny frog and you could order food for it etc. Everything had to be ordered through the company. My mom got me one when I was like 11\/12 yo (31 now). We had that first one FOREVER it seemed. We ordered another one because I liked it so much. Well apparently we had gotten one of each gender, because one day there were eggs in their tank. I decided to remove the eggs to see if they would hatch, and at some point my mom (not thinking it through) moved them to the windowsill. Eventually they hatched, and apparently the sunlight had been too much for them, because they were kinda deformed. Their front legs were.. I don’t know how to really describe it... *stuck* to their chest. But they swam around great and seemed happy and ate well and grew. Now, these frogs were only supposed to get to the size of a half dollar. Ours got *big*- like the size of your fist or maybe a little smaller. The weird deformed ones never got as big as the “parents” but they got pretty big. We had a bigger tank and everything for them and they all got along well. They were entertaining. I digress.  \n  \nOne day my mom, my day, and myself left to go on a trip to Europe. My grandma came to take care of all of our pets (dogs, cats, an iguana, the frogs, pretty sure I had a hamster or rat at the time also.) We lived in a marshy area with a river nearby. When we got back, all the animals were fine, except my frogs were gone. My grandma said she “couldn’t stand watching them swim around looking sad, especially the deformed ones, so she “released them” into the river”. I. Was. Furious. I had no idea if they could even *live* in that sort of environment and knew the deformed ones wouldn’t last a minute in the wild anyway. My grandma apologized profusely when she realized her error, but it still hurt for awhile. It’s 100% not acceptable to take somebody’s pet and just “release” it into the wild without your permission. I think the narcissist sub posted in here will help you a lot, but I just wanted you to know I feel your pain and understand. I wish there was something any of us Reddit users could do.  \n  \nEdit: I just looked it up and the kits still exist, but apparently they send a tadpole not a tiny frog.

I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\n>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to.

But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing.

Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too.

Thank you all so much for reaching out with your advice! I feel much less crazy with all the support this has gotten.

{"prompt":"8-year-old sister had asked me whether she was born was because of sex. I honestly answered “yes” because I knew she would find out sooner or later. Also, I don’t have the heart to lie to her. Although I did not delve into the lovemaking details usually reserved for Sex Ed (penis goes into vagina, sperm fertilizes egg, etc), the way she phrased her question was one where you cannot fool her into thinking she was transported by UPS storks.\n\nI was slightly relieved she didn’t press on for what I was taught in Sex Ed, but she has absorbed how pregnancy works, one by a tell-tale sign of missing a period (which she has not completely learned yet). She had gained this knowledge by subscribing to a YouTuber who talked about her pregnancy experience (I’m guessing in vlogs and AMA form).\n\nHaving her own phone, she started to do something I only remembered doing first at 15 on my desktop: googling XXX on purpose. I thought she would be searching for the movie XXX: Xander Cage or the late rapper XXXTentacion (autofill gives his profile), she actually typed in XXX as in intent to enter a pornsite. She had clicked on images and had screenfuls of naked sex, with cum dripping out in some, faces of orgasm and pain in others and period sex in one image. Her curiosity ended up in me explaining to her that the cum is “discharge” (which she didn’t probe further into) and that sex is painful, comparing it to the most painful vaccination she remembered. She listened in awe, and I was asked if I had done it before with my SO. No, sis. (context: SO didn’t consent, wanted to keep the V-card until marriage. But watched porn regularly and had friends who slept around)\n\nSince I had gone this far down the rabbit hole, I warned her that sex is by mutual consent ONLY, and she cannot do it until she is grown up (I regret not telling her both partners must be 18), and she must refuse any sexual encounters or I will personally hunt the predator down. I repeatedly emphasized that underage and\/or non-consensual sex will get her and\/or her partner thrown in jail.\n\nThe previous paragraph, yes, were big words for an 8-year-old, so I analogized it to a game of NERF (since she is a NERF enthusiast, and I have a NERF gun at home) - “you must get your friend’s permission, and both you and them must be OK with playing NERF together. If your friend says no, and you shoot them anyway, you’re a bully and will get into trouble. Because your friend already said no.”\n\nNow, she remembers having the talk as the \"NERF talk\". I’m quite shaken by this. I never had “the talk” at home growing up, and I only had Sex Ed, biology, porn, and my friends’ sexual experiences to formulate this. I am concerned with how much exposure she has when she is not with me or my folks. Should I let my dad know about the talk? Is it rude for me to tap her phone (personal property) and tighten Internet control? How do I approach this? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nAlso, if this is more appropriate for an asking parent forum do let me know. Thank you.\n\n**EDIT 1:** I have truly messed up by saying that sex is painful. Thank you for pointing it out. I was speaking about it from second hand accounts from my friends, who concur about the painful part. The orgasm\/moaning faces that my sister saw appeared to be a look of pain to her (like a ear pull) so I had wrongly concluded. If she brings it up again I will correct myself.\n\n**EDIT 2:** To those who are @-ing me for giving her wrong info - I get it. I'm living in a household where \"the talk\" is straight up taboo. We all waited until middle school to have it, and it was conducted by our school. I have no choice but to step up.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Age of consent where I live is 16. Though the law views sexual relations from 16 to 18 as dependent on the relationship. If the offender was exploitative (i.e. a person of authority such as a teacher, coach, doctor) they will be charged.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I don't think associating fear with sex is a really good idea. I had the talk at around 8-9, kids that age can handle that and if you mystify it too much or make it taboo then that might just draw her more to it because that's how curiosity works.\n\nAll kids want is to satisfy their curiosity, you can choose to help her do that in a healthy way or she'll find out in her own anyways, even if she doesn't have access to the internet her friends will fill her in, just like before the internet existed.\n\n\nBut yeah, she really should be monitored online, the dangers of sex apps and forums is just too high not just at this age but in the pre-teen and teenage stage as well.

{"prompt":"RESOLVED\n\nThis is my first post, so sorry abt formatting, on mobile.\nSo I (20 F) and my boyfriend (28 m) just finished game of thrones, we got really into it and binged it in a month, but my boyfriend has randomly started calling my cootchie Cersei and now it’s all the time. Is Cersei hungry for the D, how is Cersei today, I’m gonna f$ck Cersei later. And he does it everywhere. Yesterday we were at the grocery store and he said out loud that he was gonna “play with Cersei when we get home.” I find it to be a major turn off and have told him that but he won’t stop doing it. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I have this feeling he’s gonna rename it after whatever show we get into next. How to I get him to stop? I’ve tried calling his d!!k Tyrian and he didn’t care. —Cersei is the evil queen and Tyrian is a dwarf in case you haven’t watched game of thrones—\n\nEdit: wow I wasn’t expecting this to blow up so much, in trying to read all the comments and reply to as many as I can. Basically what I understand is that I need to stop the sex, have a serious conversation with him, and somehow make him less old.\n\nUpdate: thanks for all of the advice. I sat him down when he got home and I had a serious conversation with him about boundaries and what exactly I didn’t like about it. He did agree to stop but I expect him to slip up a few times since he’s gotten in the habit of doing it. All in all everything worked out.\n\nEdit: let me make this very clear, he didn’t go after a 17 year old. We worked together and my manager was a lesbian who had the hots for me, so she would ask him leading questions, I.e. would you bend her over and slap her ass, don’t you think those titties are juicy, ect. Then she’d relay what he’d said to me. Basically living vicariously through us. I went after him, not the other way around.

{"prompt":"(M 23)A few nights ago I was having a pretty good night with my fiancée, the usual, cuddling and having conversation. I had told my brother that he could use the majority of the house for his activities (he likes to dress up like an anime girl) when he got home and my fiancée was understanding of the situation. My brother pulls into the drive way and has brought his friend over who is a sex offender and makes me very uncomfortable cause I know what he did and there’s no excuse for doing what he did.\n\n I didn’t want my fiancée around him so I told her that it was time to go. As I’m walking her to her car I catch the friend staring her up and down. I promptly shot him a glare and walked her to her car to see her off. When I got back inside the guy starts making comments; “who’s that”, “aww I wish she didn’t have to go”, “you hitting that” and so on... I let him know that she was my fiancée and since he and myself aren’t friends I wouldn’t be discussing my relationship with him to which he quickly remarked “If it were me, I’d be fucking her til she bleeds out of every hole”. \n\nIt shocked me for a minute and I felt as if all the emotion in my body had left until the pure rage hit me like a semi truck and in an oddly calm tone that didn’t seem like my voice yet came from my mouth I simply said, “if I ever hear you say something like that again, I’ll kill you”. Now my brother is upset with me and is acting like I’m at fault for the whole situation and has even demanded I apologize to his friend. I haven’t felt close with him in a long time and he’s been mooching off of me and my parents for some time now. I just can’t choose him over my Fiancée because I care more about her than I do about him. \n\nI’ve had Army and Marine friends tell me that the feeling of emotionlessness before that rage sets in is normal and they’ve felt it too when on deployments.

You clearly stated that you weren’t comfortable discussing your relationship with him and he completely disrespected your wishes with that comment.

{"prompt":"Last night my little sister texted me on her tablet. She said she was “sad and embarrassed with a mix of disgust” (her words.) I inquired why, and she replied: “i like my best friend and she’s a girl :(“\n\nI took a minute just looking at that text and feeling so sad. Not because she likes girls, but because she’s so upset about it. Ever since she could talk, I’ve tried my hardest to raise her with the notion that some people like girls, some like boys, and some like both or neither. I do not stand as her parent in anyway and haven’t lived with her since I was 17 (which was three years ago, but my parents don’t go out of their way to let us know that it’s okay if either of us specifically are gay. They’re not homophobic as far as I know, but I personally haven’t told them about how I like girls because I’ve always felt that they would behave strangely about it. I don’t know if my sister is upset because she’s hearing something negative about gay people at home, or maybe at school. All in all, I’m not sure what is making my sister feel this way.\n\nI called up my sister to video chat as soon as my sister texted me about liking her best friend. I told her about how I found out that I like girls in addition to boys when I was fifteen. She listened to everything I had to say, but if I asked her a question she would just stare at me. The poor girl clearly didn’t want to talk about it, but still wanted to hear what I had to say. I didn’t press her any further whenever she wouldn’t talk to me, and I told her that it was okay that she didn’t want to talk about it. After that I asked her if she had told our parents, but she didn’t answer. I let her know that it was okay if she didn’t want to tell them, and that I hadn’t told our parents about me liking girls, but that it was also okay if she did want to tell them. Overall she was quiet for the whole conversation, and I tried my best to remind her that liking somebody, no matter their gender, is an incredible thing as long as they’re treating you well.\n\nI feel like I could be doing more for her. I remember trying to figure out whether I like girls or not when I was a teenager, and I can’t begin to imagine what it’s like as a child. This is an important time in her life, and I want to be there for her in every way that I can. It’s hard when I can’t relate to young children in this way, and also that we live in separate states from each other. The fact that she’s hurting about this hurts me as well. \n\nWhat can I tell her?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I read through the comments here and was surprised to find that nobody had mentioned this yet, but... Have you considered that it may be a possibility that she was aware of your sexual preferences already, and the fact that you haven’t told your parents (or, for all she knows, maybe you had told them, and they had reacted poorly which is why it isn’t discussed freely) has made her form some assumptions? Not saying that it’s your fault or trying to place blame on anyone, I just wondered if you had considered it a possibility... \n\nPerhaps (albeit she’s very young) she has felt this way her whole life, and she’s reaching out to see if you can help her by kind of testing the waters with your parents, especially since you aren’t stuck living with them like she currently is. I hope that makes sense.\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to edit and add that I DO think you handled the situation itself wonderfully, and I am sure that it means a lot to her to know that you love her unconditionally and support her.

{"prompt":"It's worth noting that I'm more than twice her age; and I'm as confused as you probably are disgusted at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to family circumstances, I'm occasionally spending time with a seemingly normal 11yo girl, a very distant relative of mine. Her and her mother are staying in the house temporarily.  Girl obviously developed a crush on me. Keeps staring at me, seeks any excuse to hug me, etc.... No big deal, I thought it was cute at first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt got weird a few nights ago. We were sitting on the couch, she's watching cartoons, I'm messing with my phone. Out of nowhere she sits in my lap, missionary style (I don't know how else to call it?), facing me, puts her arms around my neck and kisses me on a cheek.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-\"Uh Katie, what are you doing?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-\"Playing a game\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe managed to plant 2 more quick kisses on my cheek (getting uncomfortably close to my mouth) before I lifted her off me. She wouldn't let go of my neck at first, but eventually I managed to sit her down next to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her if she plays these games a lot. She vaguely described that she ocassionaly does with her best friend, who's a girl the same age. I honestly never played these games with my friends, but I heard girls can be much \"closer?\" with their girlfriends, eitherway I didn't prod too much further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tell her that we should probably do something else, implying that there's more appropriate games we can play (Monopoly?). It must have came out wrong though, because without missing a beat she says:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \"What would you like me to do to you? ...Or I can kiss you again?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe audacity and phrasing of the question stunned me. I never been painted into the corner with 2 false alternatives by a child. I chose 3rd option of \"We should call it a night\". She looked somewhere between sad, disappointing, and embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't decide what I should do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 1: Tell her really sternly that this behavior is innapropriate, and she should never do that. She's very self conscious and sensitive, and I'm afraid to make her feel like she's a bad person for what she did. I once told her jokingly to tie her shoelaces properly so she doesn't trip, and she still obsessively fixes them anytime I'm around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 2: Talk to her mother (dad is not in a picture... I know, shocking!...). I suspect her mother will chew her out, and tell her to never bother me again. I think that would be an overreaction, that might also damage her self-esteem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 3: Try not to be alone with her anymore. Ignore her affections as much as possible. Continue to gently remove myself out of difficult situations if they arise again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm leaning towards Option 3, since it requires minimum actions on my part.

My old house had like 3 different ways to get there that all took about the same amount of time. \n\nSorry you’re in this tough situation OP.\n\n**Edit 1: Added context to The Good Place part in parenthesis so y’all can better understand the situation in the show.**\n\n**Edit 2: Just read your edit OP, and I think that’s a great thing to do! The signs and the donation could definitely save way more than 3 ducks. My only advice is to maybe get your neighbor to spread the birdseed in the grass to deter them away from the parking lot. We need more people like OP in this world.** END"}

{"prompt":"So earlier this year I moved in with my Aunt. Everything was fine until recently. They have told me they plan to shut off the Internet everyday from 11 PM - 5 AM. I go to college and right now since Covid is on I stay up pretty late. I moved to Toronto from a Middle Eastern country and around that time is when I can play with my friends,talk to my mom ,etc. It's also quite honestly my only private time due to another issue. I'm a muslim and they make me pray, we have to pray 5 times a day *together*. This is extremely annoying, we end one prayer at 11 PM and start the next at 5 AM. I am honestly getting pretty sick and tired of praying together everyday as it's kind of a timesuck that takes longer then praying alone. When I moved here I was not aware of these conditions, I moved here under the pretense of the WiFi being available 24\/7 and that I wouldn't have to pray 5 times together everyday. I pay 1000$ a month in rent which is pretty much the same if not slightly more expensive then the places around me. Is it fair for me to request that the internet remains on in the night and that I will not pray every single prayer with them?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. You're a human, and an adult.

{"prompt":"So I bet a guy from work (3 weeks after the election!!) $5000 that  Biden would be President on inauguration day. He was drinking the kool aid hard reading all sorts of crazy shit 1000% convinced Trump would remain in office. He'd send me Tik Tok videos as proof every day of random ass  people explaining how it was going to happen. Seeing how relentless he  was I said why don't you put your money where your mouth is. Soon enough  a $500 bet quickly escalated into a legit $5000 bet after lots of  ridiculous back and forth.\n\nSo here we are, I won, and you're not gonna believe it but the Trump guy is being a sore loser!! He is 100% going to pay me but he is  trying to win the only way he can - by making it a pain in the ass for me to get my money so he can have a laugh.\n\nHe has ordered 75 small aluminum pill containers ([see here](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07C14SXSM\/)) and has about 15 home depot buckets ([see here](https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2\/100087613)) which he intends to fill with  concrete. As of now his plan appears to be to put hundred dollar bills  (50) scattered throughout the pill containers and buckets of concrete. Rebar or wire mesh may be used. He included me in a giant work group message where he is grandstanding  his plans ([see here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/6rOaOKj)) - that's how I know all this. Once again this  is the only way a guy who just lost $5000 can \"win\" - right  out of the Trump playbook!\n\nAt this point his intention is to make me work as much as possible for the money for a laugh. He  certainly will put more thought into making this a pain in the ass for  me than he did making the bet in the first place.\n\nMy goal at this point is to give him as little satisfaction as possible or even flip this in my favor and completely take the wind out of his sails. Since he revealed the pill containers he ordered, as a preemptive strike plan, I went ahead myself and ordered 75 of them as well.  They'll be here Friday along with a stack of fake hundreds from Amazon. Here's a couple  scenarios:\n\n1. He does not put the money in any of the pill containers in an  effort to simply hand me the money after I crack through all the  concrete just to have a laugh at me. IF he does this - I could open 2-3  buckets to get a gauge for what's in the buckets\/containers. If it  appears the are empty I present to him my own 75 pill containers that I  easily covered with my own concrete mix and he would thus unknowingly  foil his own plan. At this point I'd feel him out for info and see if he  turns over money then. I'd pretend he got me good (video and all) then I  could then drop the full concrete buckets in his truck and send him a  video revealing I have outsmarted him. This is best case scenario.\n2. He fills 50 of the 75 pill containers which would make sense for 50 $100 bills and 75 total pill bottles. In this case I'd have no choice  but to go through them all. This would be his best move guaranteeing I  go through them all. In this case my only winning move would be to dump  the 75 containers that I ordered (with concrete on them) in his truck at  work the next day to make it seem like it only took me one day to get  the money. Then later just chip away at the buckets myself.\n3. I have to crack open all the buckets but then fill my own buckets with pill containers and concrete and give them back to him. The ol' bait and switch. I can also preemptively do this - so almost on the same day or next day I give them back to him so he thinks they are the same buckets he gave me and develop a story around that. Photoshopping pictures is an option as well.\n\nHelp me out Reddit! I either need a good counter plan or some good advice on getting these containers out of the concrete! A hammer drill? Could I drop them from the top of a bridge? Or find someone with an old fire department ladder truck and rent it for an hour to drop them from the top?\n\n**Current payback plan:** u\/[amasterblaster](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/amasterblaster\/) has a brilliant idea. Take the fake buckets to his house. Offer a $2000 settlement if he takes them back. If he says no leave the buckets. If he says yes go directly to ATM get $2000 from him. Let him crack open all the staged buckets - then when he comes looking for his 2 grand back I give it back to him in concrete!! Or I plant the 2 grand in the buckets so he realizes theres money there but comes up $3000 short and realizes his folly.\n\n**Current concrete busting plans:** Sledgehammer for potential simplicity, dexpan a non explosive expanding agent for concrete, rotary hammer, or a simple excavator to smash the shit out of the blocks.\n\n**Few responses to comments:** I'm not suing him. I'm not turning him into authorities for ruining money - its not getting ruined. He 100% IS paying the money. I've known him a long time this isn't a random person. He's just busting my balls.\n\nP.S. I couldn't in good faith take the money knowing some people died because of this conspiracy theory so I am donating a portion of the  winnings to the deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick's family. If anyone has info on best place for this please let me know as I  have not yet researched this.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would recommend slowly chiseling it, if you buy a pick axe or jackhammer you will most likely destroy the money, it may be slow but chiseling it is the best way, buy a hammer, a chisel, and watch videos to learn to properly use them.

{"prompt":"UPDATE AT BOTTOM\n\nMy coworker recently lost his car--don't know the details, probably broke down or something.  He had to cancel his own wedding for his son's funeral last weekend.  He's in a really shitty spot.  I don't think this guy is one of those \"make someone feel sorry in order to take advantage of them\" types so...\n\nI was already kinda half-ass looking around at newer cars, waiting for a deal for a few months now but not *needing* one ASAP.  When I heard this guy was ubering to and from work every day I was like, holy shit I'll just go ahead and pull the trigger on a new-to-me car and give him my old car.  \n\nI have decided I'm going to do it but I have no idea HOW to do it.  I want to preserve his dignity so I'm not going to make a big show of it, in fact, I really don't like the fact that our coworkers will figure it out when they see him driving my car.  I don't feel like I'm doing it for self-aggrandizement, everything just happened to line up to where I can really help this guy.  I'd have donated it to NPR because I wouldn't get much in trade and don't want to hassle with selling.  \n\nHow should I approach this?  What is the most graceful way to give this to him, and refuse payment if he offers it, and not let it be weird?  I mean, I know I can only control my side of things but if there are some things I can say or do that would make it easier I'd appreciate some insight.  \n\nIn my mind, I was thinking of inviting him into an empty office and just being like look dude.  I want you to have this.  But then... what?  What if I offend him?  What if he refuses to take it and continues to Uber into work?  What if he gets weird afterwards?  My boyfriend said I should offer to sell it to him for a super-low price so it doesn't feel like charity, but I feel kinda tacky being like \"hey I know you have all this shit going on but if you give me 500 bucks I'll give you my car\"?  Nah that won't work for me.  Maybe I could offer to sell but be super insistent that I will NEVER ask him when he will pay me and he can get it back to me whenever he wants, 5 bucks at a time if he needs to but really I am not trying to make money off this.  I just want to help my colleague.  He's kind, warm, and hard-working and he's dealing with a bunch of shit.  A big steaming shit pile.  I can't sit here KNOWING I can help him and just ...shake him down or do nothing.  \n\nHow do I even remotely handle this\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo, I showed up right as he was walking across the lot to his truck to leave for the week.  I ran up and was like, \"hey!  How you holding up?\" He sighed heavily and said \"I am getting through it because I must get through it.\" I asked, \"Have you come to a solution for your car problem?\" And he sighed again and said, \"Yes, the solution is that I must have one and can't afford another.\" We were about 20 yards away from employee parking and could see both my cars so I said, \"Well, this weekend I bought that car (point at new car) and so now I would like you to have that one (point at old car).\" \n\nHe was absolutely speechless, so I kinda started talking fast and was like \"I couldn't find the title--it's in my closet somewhere--but I have all the necessary paperwork you need to bring to the Iowa DOT to transfer it into your name.  I'll pay for a replacement title if I can't find it, and it's overdue for an oil change so I'll get that done this week while you're out too.  I'll leave the keys on my desk so you have them if you get back after I leave on Friday.\"\n\nI attempt to look in his eyes but his mask has fogged his glasses.  I continue.\n\n\"Yeah, they only offered me 98 dollars for the car and I didn't think it was worth it and I didn't really want to hassle with selling it online.  Also I don't have space at home to keep it, so I thought to myself, *why not let [coworker] have it?* So here we are.\"\n\nHe has begun shaking.  It's 15 degrees so I am getting pretty cold at this point and I start hopping a little.\n\n\"So...would you take my car please?\" I ask, by way of concluding the offer and requesting some kind of feedback. \n\nImmediately, he grabbed me around the shoulders and pulled me in for a long, strong hug.  He is openly weeping into my hair now.  He is saying something but my scarf is muffling his words, but I let him hang on until he decides to pull back.  Finally he removed his glasses, and he looked me in the eyes and said, \"You have changed my life with this gift.  I cannot describe what you have given me.\" So of course I started crying and we hugged again.  Then, he said I must be freezing and I am to go into the office immediately, so I did.  He sat out in his truck for a while before finally leaving for the week, and I feel content that he did not insist on haggling over money.  Perhaps if he decides later to bring it up, I will entertain what he has to say, but for now I am well satisfied with how this turned out.  Now I just have to find that damn title 😵\n\nI want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read this and took the time to reply.\n\nAs it turns out, I was totally overthinking how this was going to go!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'd make sure i had all the transfer papers with me and like you said take him into an empty office.

We had problems like everyone else but we both talked regularly about how we had a strong relationship and were in love. 2 years ago I moved away to follow my career, but I drove back every other weekend to visit. \n\nAs set up, he never had public social media besides Snapchat, and was usually pretty private about his phone and didn’t like having pictures taken. I wasn’t crazy about it, but I respected his lifestyle. \n\nThis May, we made the hard but logical decision to separate because our careers were taking us down very different paths. But a month later we decided to get back together because we loved each other that much, and wanted to make the distance work. We had both slept with other people in that time, but he was always extremely upset about my actions during our breakup (as far as he told me, I had slept with one more person than him). \n\nWhen he’d get drunk, he’d get really mean about it. This wasn’t exactly new behavior, but he was always apologetic and I, knowing his struggles with depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma, was always forgiving. \n\nA week ago, he got drunk and was being verbally cruel again. He texted me goodbye, and the next morning I had his friend check on him and his body was found. I was devastated, blaming myself, and was making plans to follow him out [ plug: I am no longer feeling suicidal] During the visitation and funeral, his family were so kind to me and I didn’t deserve it. \n\nAfter the funeral, the girl he had been sleeping with was sharing stories, and I picked up on some things that indicated to me that they had been together the last 2 months. After speaking to her, I learned that he had told many of his friends that we had broken up a year and a half ago, and that they’d been dating the whole time. I confirmed it with others, and saw the texts. \n\nThis began a rabbit hole of learning that he had also slept with at least 2 other people in the last 6 months. Saw the texts to confirm. I went with his family to deal with the things in his house. I found letters and things from his other relationships, but nothing from ours. I also found nudes from dozens of other people backed up to his computer 6 months into our relationship.\n\nHis family and other friends keep telling me he really loved me, that I was important to have been the only one to meet the family. But it all feels like a lie, the entire past 5 years of my life. \n\nI keep oscillating between feeling everything and feeling empty. I want to believe some of it was real, and I don’t want to, but I just don’t know. I lost my best friend and love of my life only to learn he was never mine. I also feel so gross, knowing how many people he’s been with. I can’t eat, I’m afraid to sleep and see him in my dreams, and the pictures make me nauseous. \n\nI know I need therapy, I just can’t afford it right now. Does anyone have advice on what to do? I’m also torn about telling some of our mutual friends that didn’t know. I don’t know if I want to destroy their image of him especially right after he died. I’m so lost.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I don’t know what was actually in his heart. From an outsider looking in, you were the one he kept and probably did love. The guy was struggling to fill some empty hole he felt was there. These flings, these affairs may have been attempts to fill some need that was not tied in any way to you. We don’t know why he felt this was appropriate, but the suicide tells us he was desperate to fill something up that he felt was missing. END"}

I also have no idea how long he has been in my house, because none of the doors or windows have been open today. He seems friendly and let me stroke him for a while until hiding under my bed. Not sure why I let him go under there but I can’t really see how to get him out now. He doesn’t have a collar but seems pretty fat and his coat is shiny, so he doesn’t look like a stray to me anyway. Has anyone got any idea what I should do? Should I feed him or should I take him out to my garden and let him go? Also if anyone could give me any advice on how to get him out from under my bed without scaring him or grabbing him that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT:UPDATE\n\nFirstly thank you all for the advice! I coaxed him out from under my bed with a little plate of tuna and he seemed to enjoy that. I sat on the floor with him for a while and gave him some water. Decided to open my back door (downstairs) just incase he wanted to leave and he got up and walked down the stairs and out the door - i'm hoping this is just some kind of cat intuition because otherwise god knows how many times this cat has been in my house to know the layout of it. Did feel a little bit heartbroken honestly but he actually just sat under a bush in my garden for a while, so I left my back door open incase he wanted to come back inside. This was a little while ago so i thought he's probably gone by now, but just stepped out into my garden and and guess who's here! I'll leave the backdoor open if he feels like coming back inside but he seems pretty chill just wandering around. He can hop my neighbours fence so I think he'll be on his way. Hopefully he'll come back tomorrow, but glad the little guy kept me company for a bit in quarantine anyway. Hope he finds his way home soon, thanks again for the advice everyone :)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That's how you get a cat in the first place.  \nCheers, you're a cat owner now!  \n\n\nI ended up having 6 cats this way...

{"prompt":"Hey, so I was on a walk around 1pm today and saw this little girl walking by herself in her pj’s. I stopped and asked if she was ok and she said she couldn’t find her mom. So I asked her if she could take me to her house and I would try and help her. We get to her house and walk in and the mom is there dead. I brought the girl outside and called 911 and they asked me if I could do CPR and I said no she’s cold and has no pulse. It was a really horrible scene to see. The police got there quickly and I stayed with the girl for a bit. Neighbours started coming up who knew the girl and talked with her. I left to get the girl some snacks and some of my daughters clothes as they were the same age and she was in filthy pj’s and hadn’t eaten all day. The girl said her mom was like that when she woke up so she had been in the house with her dead mother for like 5-6 hours, it was just awful. I left when children’s aid showed up and went and get a few toys for the girl. She was very happy with them when I brought them for her. She didn’t seem to really understand what had happened I don’t think.\n\nI’ve cried a lot since it happened and I’ve talked to some friends. I’m so exhausted that I can barely move and just keep staring off into space. I’ve had traumatic experiences before but I’ve never seen a dead person.

{"prompt":"We got in an altercation yesterday evening, it started in the car and continued once we got home.\n\nI went to separate myself from him once our year old son and myself got inside our apartment. I went to his nursery and since it didn’t have a lock on the door I grabbed a chair to wedge it beneath the handle in hopes he’d not come in but he ended up forcing it open therefore broke the door of the hinges. Later my grandma asked me, \n\n“Well you had to know he’d do that, right?”\n\nAfter he got into the bedroom he immediately started to belittle me and yell at me, I asked him to please go away. He started yelling and told me no while saying,\n\n “What are you gonna do about it? Make me. Make me get out! You can’t do shit.”\n\nTo try and get past him while he stood in the doorway I tried to shove past him but he shoved me back then he punched out the lamp in our sons room and glass went everywhere around our son. I started sobbing while he stomped off— I heard banging noises and saw he had punched a huge hole in the wall by our front door.\n\nWhat eventually led me to calling the cops was when I was trying to leave for the night and he scooped up our son and told me I wasn’t taking him anywhere. The whole time I was trying to be calm and kept telling him,\n\n “I’m not taking him away from you but we need to go somewhere else tonight.”\n\nEventually I followed him out to the car where he tried to speed off with our son in his lap but I took the keys from him so he just started screaming while thrashing our son around in his lap. I warned him multiple times that I was going to call 911 and he just kept saying,\n\n “Do it, you think I’m scared?”\n\n\nI felt like he didn’t leave me much choice, the police came, saw his bloody knuckles from punching the wall, took my statement and also got his before taking him out in handcuffs. I’m at my friends house, I can’t sleep, I don’t know what to do. My grandparents who usually support me most in all the world gas lighted me and hinted at that I must of done something to set him off like that. \n\n\nHow long will he be in jail for? He takes sleeping medication to sleep as well as mood control pills and he won’t have those. I feel terrible but once he’s out and we get a moment to talk I feel that we should go our separate ways but share custody of our son— as the relationship is toxic and just isn’t healthy. My grandparents want me to really think about this and consider not leaving him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit;    Thank you all for your support and advice, it’s been a very difficult day— my grandparents recently called my dad and now my dad is also doubting me when before he was with me.

That includes using protection, cleaning up any messes, and being respectful of anyone else in the house (in this case, the parents).

{"prompt":"Hi all,  \n\nSo today has been really shitty for me.  And I mean,  really,  really shitty.  I woke up from a horrific dream that affected me and made cry during the day whenever I thought about it,  I took a diazapham tablet just to calm me enough, but all in all,  I've been pretty out of it today.  I made a few mistakes at work but not that drastic until this arvo.  My mum is very verbally abusive,  which is why I'm living independently at 16. And today it was non stop. \nA couple came in to return a 1000 dollar reel for a bigger version,  and they left it on the front counter with me, I put it right infront of me to watch it.  I served a guy,  he bought a $600 fridge,  and I must've missed him pick up the reel and walk out with it.  At the time,  I had received another message from my mum and I was reading it.  This is all on camera, and my manager came up infront of all my teammates and the couple,  she told me it was cause I was on my phone and she was pissed. She said to go get my stuff and piss off,  I wasn't even finished with my job.  She held everyone back to help except me,  I was mortified.  I don't blame her,  I love my manager and I know it's my fault.  Im fairly new,  so it's still really hard for me to fit in,  and I get anxious everytime I walk through the doors, and I  have no fucking clue how I'm supposed to go in tomorrow. \n\nPs: \nMy manager just called me,  she said the reel was  returned and they copped a whole lot of abuse from the guys'  daughter. But apparently they all stood up for me,  and the couple even said they werent angry at me,  and it was really shitty for a grown man to steal from a young girl. She was super lovely,  she told me she's not angry and she just wanted to see how I was going and told me not to stress, and that if I ever needed anything to call her. This made me feel a lot better,  but I would love any advice I could get ♥ \n\n###\n\n","completion":" It's going to be ok. Everyone is bound to make a mistake at their job at one point or another. I made many mistakes before in my job and a manager 3 levels higher than me (my bosses bosses boss) pretty much yelled at me for it. I felt terrified at that time. But things just carried on as usual. That event passed with us just correcting the problem. although at a lost cost of course. \n\n&#x200B;\n\npoint is, these moments WILL come. So best we can do is try to brace ourselves and accept what's coming. Just apologize sincerely and admit your mistake. Show\/say that you will try better and not let something like that happen again. and hopefully the consequences will not be big or you will be given a chance to make up for it. (ask for a chance even. nothing illegal\/immoral though). Things are mostly negotiable at the work place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Be careful of using the phone at work. Make sure you choose the right time for it and not let it get in the way of work. Unless emergency ofc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! I'm sorry your mom's verbally abusive :(  END"}
{"prompt":"[Original post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/cd9tqr\/im20_accidentally_befriended_a_12_year_old_girl\/)\n\nI apologize if updates aren't allowed, I messaged the mods and got no response so I'm just going to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.\n\nSome helpful people suggested I contact my local version of the Big Brother program, and they were happy to help me out getting everything official and less sketchy, although they needed her guardian's permission first. On my part I needed to get a background check from the police.\n\nI sat down with her and explained what I was planning, and she seemed excited. I was a bit worried about what would happen when I asked to contact her parents as previous attempts had not been successful, but she gave me their phone number, and we got to chatting about the fun things we could do outside of just playing tennis.\n\nI gave her mother a call the next day and explained who I was, how I knew her daughter and why I thought it would be a good idea for me to become her Big Brother. Her mother seemed very weirded out, understandably, but over all pretty nice. We agreed that I would drive her home the next time we played tennis so we could meet in person.\n\nThe day came and after kicking her ass (my forehand is mint boi), we hopped in the car and headed to her place. Her mother was just as I imagined from speaking on the phone, a completely normal human being. Her father however was a different story. If I say he was creepy it implies something sexual, but I don't mean creepy in that way. He had almost no emotions, he smiled when he first saw me, but it was not a normal smile. If I said something funny and he would laugh, but it was like a robot might laugh. Very fucking bizarre dude, just something off about him. Overall though I thought our meeting went well, they just asked that I wait until I got my background check before I did anything other than play tennis with her which is super reasonable and I'm actually glad they weren't willing to sign their kid up to some strange dude without it.\n\nI went home and was super happy with how everything went. I was a tad worried her house was going to be some shit-hole and her parents were going to be druggies, but my fears were thankfully unfounded. A few days went past, and I was chillin', when I got a knock on the door. I open it and 3 cops are standing there looking too happy to see me. They ask me to come down to the station for an interview about the girl, although they tell me I'm not being arrested and it is voluntary. I may come across as naive in my last post, but even I can see that I need a fucking lawyer, so I tell them I'll meet with them when the time suits me.\n\nAfter frantically Googling around for a lawyer, I find one who seems to be competent. He rings the police station and asks what they want to interview me about, but they are tight-lipped and only let on that it's about me hanging out with the kid. I speak to my lawyer for a bit and despite his hesitation, I agree to meet with the police and try and explain whats going on. I bring with me as much evidence as I can, my call logs to child services (surprisingly difficult to request that where I live annoyingly), my correspondences with the Big Brother people, I even printed off my Reddit post. Anything to make me look like the upstanding person I am.\n\nThe interview was nice, when I started laying out evidence of my good-intent they were surprisingly accepting of it. The fact that I had made multiple calls to child services went a long way to convincing them I meant no harm. There were a couple of things that irked me though, and I don't know if they will ever stop irking me. I overheard the police multiple times say \"he's not the guy\". The way they said it implied they were still looking for someone after me. The next thing that irked me was one of the officers told me that the reason he didn't think it was me was because \"when she texted you and said her boobs were sore, you didn't engage.\" I've read through our text messages 3 times now looking for anything vaguely similar to that sentiment and I'm coming up with zip. I mean, I know nothing would turn up because I have never talked to a kid about their boobs in my life, but still I've triple checked.\n\nI've thought it over and over in my mind, and the only conclusion I can make is that I was not the only man she was interacting with. I can't think of anything else. Why else would the police imply they'll keep looking for someone after clearing me? And then to bring up a conversation that never happened? He must've confused my convos with someone else's. At least if she has been interacting with other people in inappropriate ways the police are involved and they can catch the guy, but sure as shit I'm not speaking to her ever again.\n\nThank you to everyone for their advice, it definitely was inappropriate of me to be hanging out with her alone and I'm glad you guys told me so. My background check came in the mail today and so I think I will still go ahead with signing up with the Big Brother program, but it will be with a random kid and more importantly with their parents permission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: My lawyer was with me for the police interview, he just thought it was a bad idea. What does he know though, pfft I've seen Better Call Saul Season 1, I know all about the law.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sounds like the parents checked their daughters mobile phone, after talking to you. Seems like you were not the only person she talked to and cops\/parents confused you with the other guy. I hope everything turns out right for her, without harm.

{"prompt":"When I was 15 my dad got a girlfriend, my parents were divorced for 2 months at this point, and I was told she would be moving in in about 2 weeks. Not even 24 hours later I was told she, her 2 kids, and her dog would be moving in in 3 days because she got kicked out of her apartment. \n\nI decided I would still live with my dad because I thought it would be kind of cool to have another person to share clothes with (teenage girl thinking)\n\nMy dad and I were two peas in a pod, we were best friends, we would do everything together. Shopping were thursday’s, homemade pizzas were saturday’s, waffles were sunday’s, and movies were monday’s. \n\nI asked him to go see a new movie with me because it seemed so cool, we’d watch horror movies all the time together. Who did he take, the day it came out, without telling me about it? My stepfamily. It really hurt. \n\nFast forward to that christmas, I got a T-shirt from walmart as a gift from my dad. My stepmom got a new car and a new phone. My stepsister got a new phone and a bunch of new clothes from adidas, tommy hilfiger, and guess. My stepbrother got a new phone and 2 pairs of Jordan’s. The dog got a bunch of toys, a new bed and a new collar. I got less than the dog. \n\nI got a gift from my grandma of victoria’s secret\/pink clothes, and a $200 visa gift card. I was so excited the next day to grab my gift card and use it on something I found online. I couldn’t find the box. The box with all of the VS\/PINK and the gift card were gone. \n\nLong story short I ended up finding it in my stepsisters room. I told my dad that she took my gift from my grandma (it was over $300 worth of stuff, I wasn’t going to not say anything) and I was hit with, “well why were you in her room? you shouldn’t have been in there. why would she take it? I don’t think she would do that.”\n\nAll of a sudden, my dad and all of my stepfamily was immediately against me and were all talking shit. Apparently the next day my stepsister had money go missing from her room, who does she instantly go to blame? Me. \n\nMy dad kicked me out, I never got my gifts from my grandma back, she passed away not even 6 months later. Those were my last presents from her, and I never got to enjoy them or say thank you because I was so upset about the situation. \n\nMy stepsister ended up finding her money a week later after it got washed in the laundry machine. My dad called me and apologized after he realized I was right about everything, I didn’t talk to him for almost 2 years after that. We eventually picked up contact again, but it’s genuinely just not the same. He’s a completely different person, mentally, physically and emotionally. We see each other maybe once every 3 months, when we would spend every day together. He was my best friend, and now I can’t even recognize him anymore. \n\nIf you still have your dad, or your parents, and you are on good terms please give them a big hug and tell them how grateful you are for them. I wish I told my dad I was grateful for the relationship we had before it got destroyed by my stepfamily. I dont think I can forgive my dad for choosing people he was with for 6 months, vs his daughter for 15 years at that point. I want to forgive him, but it was such a traumatic experience.

{"prompt":"I had Pita for 11 years. She was with me through moves, boyfriends, jobs, you name it—and was perfect.  She never barked or bit. Her barks were like little chirps. My road trip buddy. She was house trained, and just the sweetest, most pure soul. She wanted love and to lick you constantly. Her little butt wiggles and standing on two legs reaching for me. Her army crawls in bed. She was PERFECT, and my whole WORLD. I loved her deeply and spoiled her. Gave her so much love. Carried her everywhere (6lb Chihuahua). Our family vet adored her and also gave her so much love.  Oh and her snores made me smile every night before I fell asleep! She LOVED me and adored me unconditionally, every single day of her life.\n\nPita was diagnosed with a stage 3-4 heart murmur two months ago. There were no other symptoms. She was still happy and lovey, and the vet thought with treatment, Pita would be okay. \n\nYesterday at 5am, Pita was breathing fast and labored, while also sounding like she was choking. We rushed her to the er vet who put her on oxygen. By 8am, we were informed by the vet that Pita was critical. She had begun bleeding and foaming at the mouth and the vet heard loud crackling in her lungs. I was shocked. I looked at my husband in disbelief. Almost stupid. This was so sudden. She was fine the night before, we had bed snuggles! I asked what we have to do to get her well. My husband had already realized what this meant. The er vet was “closed” by that point, but said he would remain open for us to decide. The dr gave us the option of transporting her across the street to a different vet (as she wouldn’t have made the 30 min trip to our family vet), or to put her down. Her organs were all rapidly failing. I called my family vet and had our dr talk to the er dr. When I took my phone back, she was kind but honest—it wasn’t looking good. Late stages of congestive heart failure! But I wanted to fight for her!! My husband and I asked to see her—and when we did, we knew it was time to do right by her. And we did. Before she went to sleep, she made one more attempt to army crawl to me for kisses—and that killed me. We stayed with her talking and petting her until the end. \n\nMy problem now (besides obviously losing the best pup ever), is that I not only feel lost, and heart achingly sad—I feel an immense amount of guilt. The last moment I had her, I handed her to stranger and she didn’t want to let go. I gave her to the nurse to help her—but I thought wholeheartedly that I would get her back. I think about the times I left her while I was at work. How I told her to hush sometimes when she would chirp chirp chirp. How I didn’t let her feel the sun one last time. How I didn’t put her on the bed every single night, just some nights. What if there was a chance and I didn’t make the right call?? What if I killed my dog needlessly?? I have so many regrets. And it’s hurting as much as the pain. \n\nMy husband and our family vet said she had the best life. She was spoiled rotten and knew how much she was loved every second of the day. That her spirit is still with me but I DONT FEEL IT! \n\nI love animals and have several other rescues and a cat, but I don’t know if I should get another. Would Pita be upset? Think I’ve replaced her and she didn’t matter? How do I get over this absolute pain? And the guilt? I’ve been crying for 30 hours straight. I miss her so badly. I miss everything. \n\nPlease help me, I’m hurting so badly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am SO SORRY for your loss!! Know that what you’re feeling is normal.

{"prompt":"So my friend and I were eating at our local diner the other afternoon and we ordered pancakes\/hash browns along with a hot coco and chocolate milkshake. Once I got the chocolate milkshake I immediately noticed the taste to be quite different and  funky than what I am used to, especially considering that I order it all the time at the same diner. Upon noticing the oddly weird taste I asked my friend to taste it as well and she agreed that there was definitely something in my milkshake. In all of honesty, it tasted very much like rum with a spike of alcohol. \n\nAfter debating continuously with my friend about the odd taste I requested for a new milkshake. Particularly, this time “mint chocolate” instead of the original “chocolate” flavor, since I assumed maybe it was the chocolate in the milkshake that triggered such a funky taste. Once the waiter arrives at our table, I explain to him how weird my chocolate milkshake tastes. His reaction to my complaint was quite amateur and he kept arguing with me . He even randomly blurted out how “there is nothing in that milkshake besides chocolate ice cream!”. Definitely suspicious right ?!\n\nOkay fast forward moments later, he finally brings me my “mint chocolate” milkshake replacement. His behavior was slightly rude as he plonked the milkshake on our table and left, didn’t even apologize or show some common courtesy\/mannerisms. Okay, now I tried the new milkshake which tasted even more like rum\/alcohol than the one before. My friend agreed as well and could taste the alcohol. Why in the world would he put alcohol in my milkshake?! My friend and I  look like we can pass as our late teens, hence this waiter didn’t even know our age. By the way, I am 22 and she is 21. I’m glad my friend was driving and that my taste buds were able to pick up on the excessive amount of alcohol that was in my milkshake. \n\nAfterwards, we asked the waiter for a to-go cup so that we could take the milkshake home and he began to shake and wouldn’t answer. Prior to that he also kept looking at us from afar while we were eating. On an interesting side note, we also noticed how he switched from working up front to the bar area and back which raised further suspicion. \n\nEventually, he brought me a to-go cup and we went home and even our parents confirmed that there was rum\/alcohol in my milkshake.

He is BY NO MEANS FINACIALLY ABLE TO DO SO SO RIGHT NOW and so I told him no for that exact reason - and also told him that I had no intention of living with just 1 other person that is why I am in this big house and trying to find roommates to fill these 2 empty rooms. If I wanted to live with 1 other dude and that's it I'd move in with my boyfriend or my dad for crying out loud!! \n\nAfter more conversation in circles he decided he was just going to move out. The conversation ended at 7:30 pm and he was up till 1am banging around and carrying on. \n\nThis morning I discover not only did he pack up all of his things from the common areas in the house,  but a certain part of the downstairs smelled like bleach. It was time for me to give my sick turtle who is in a quarantine tank right now (thank god) 1 of his 2 daily soaks. I take some of the water from his aquarium and put it in a plastic storage bin to do so. When I went to scoop out some water from my turtles aquarium \n\nI noticed the smell was WAY WORSE. \n\nThere was bleach in my aquarium!!?????????? \n\nI checked the chemical levels and sure enough, there was definitely bleach in there. When he heard me come downstairs to get the water I could hear him locking his door and he has been hiding in there ever since. \n\nIf I wouldn't have noticed the bleach smell coming from the water - my turtle would be dead right now. This man tried to murder my innocent turtle!?\n\nWhat should I do? I'm uncomfortable to be in the house rn and to leave (and obviously I'm super upset). \n\nWhy would he do this? He has worked professionally with animals for years- I am just sickened 😭\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Fuck the ultimatum or waiting, call the cops and landlord asap. This man is clearly a danger to others if he's willing to pour bleach into an aquarium tank. I'd hate to think what else he did in between the end of the conversation and the moment you found out he attempted to kill your turtle. END"}

Here he is: [PIC](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SvdcVeX)\n\nSo here’s what happened:\n\nAfter three days of keeping Satan in the crate, I realized two things.\n\n1) That if I was kidnapped by a random guy coming into my house and brought to a new place, then kept in a cage 24\/7, I wouldn’t be too friendly either. And 2) that I can’t keep a cat in a cage indefinitely and just hope the situation magically improves somehow. Besides, I’m kind of tired of getting my hands fucked with every time I try to feed him.\n\nSo my wife (the fucking trooper, she) and I decided to make a big compromise and started sleeping in the living room, leaving the cat to be out of the cage completely in my room.\n\nThe first three days, he would either run under my bed or into my closet and stare at me with wide eyes while making low guttural noises.\n\nOn the fourth day, I decided I would start to talk to it (mainly out of frustration) and start explaining to Satan that although I get it, he needs to chill the fuck out. He seems incredibly confused by this.\n\nEventually this seemed to work, and despite still not wanting to be touched, he stopped growling at me and signaling an imminent attack. That day I learned that cats understand tone like dogs.\n\nThis talking to him continued throughout the week and drove Satan to come out of the closet or under the bed while I was in the room, but if I moved at all he’d hiss and dart back to cover.\n\nEventually something changed at the start of the second week and Satan started to get on the bed while I was in the room, which lead into him getting on top of furniture while I was in the room.\n\nAll throughout the ordeal I’m looking at cat body language videos to try and understand the animal. Also, I’m the only one feeding him and trying to get him to be okay with me being around while he eats.\n\nSomehow, one day I go into the room and, seeing him on the bed, I decide to plop down next to him to see if he’ll attack me. He mrrreeeeewwws lowly, but doesn’t attack, I look away from him, lean back and stay there for a while, pretending like this is not a terrible inconvenience for either of us. Satan obliged me and played along.\n\nMoving into the third week, I can sit in the bed and lay next to Satan and he shows no signs of aggression, so I try my next move: Putting one of my extremities RIGHT NEXT to him.\n\nI do this many times a day, acting like it’s not a big deal, and eventually while laying next to him, I touch him with my knee (I figured if he goes into attack mode, I’d rather have the sweet protection of thick denim).\n\nSatan immediately protests but doesn’t move away, so mid week I try to touch him with my arm and to my surprise he’s okay with that too.\n\nBy this point I’ve also made a habit of cleaning his box and opening the blinds for him in the morning so he’ll be able to look out the window. I slow blink before leaving to work and he slow blinks back.\n\nBefore I knew it, it was the fourth week and Satan’s letting me pet him for short periods of time and only certain parts of his back, before hissing or lightly swatting (as opposed to the vicious war crimes he was trying to pull off initially).\n\nIt’s the middle of the fourth week and at this point, we’ve built enough of a tacit communication that I feel comfortable fully petting him, talking to him, and letting him walk around the house while my dog’s out on a walk.\n\nAt this point, I come in the room every day in the morning to change and talk to Satan, and he talks back and DEMANDS to be petted by me. On my off days, I go in the room and he’ll follow me around.\n\nBy the end of the fourth week, I play with Satan and he lets me pick him up. I finally realize he was actually a very sweet, super scared kitty that needed to feel safe and be given space, and furthermore everything negative that happened was my fault for not understanding him and pressuring him.\n\nBy then, I already feel he’s social enough that I can offer him around, but just for good measure I keep him for one more (fifth) week (which was enough for me to bond with him and feel bad about giving him away).\n\nMy wife and I discuss whether or not to keep him, but my dog (who’s named after a Mexican narco, but that’s a different story) ends up going after a cat when we’re walking him (it was dark) and getting hurt, which ends that line of thinking.\n\nThe week went by smoothly, and I manage to get his medical records from my friend’s family and the hospital Satan was taken to.\n\nSixth week, I take to Facebook and, with due disclaimers, I offer him around:\n\n>Satan, older cat, needs a new home\n\n>Former cat of a loner\n\n>Affectionate but needs house without children or other pets\n\n>Is curious and playful once it gets comfortable\n\nA lot of people offer to take Satan into their homes, and a lot of people don’t meet the requirements I outlined.\n\nEventually someone reaches out to me and not only are they a perfect fit for him, they understand all the constraints that go into adapting an older cat into a new home. They came yesterday and I didn’t even struggle to get him into the carrier they brought.\n\nI went into their home today to take some of Satan’s playthings as well as some food I had left over, and although he was hiding under the bed and mrrrewing, he peeked out on the halfway while my wife and I talked to his new owners.\n\nI stressed to these people that if they have any big issues with him he’s 100% returnable, but (unlike me) this isn’t their first adopted cat. We promised to keep in touch, and I came back and cleaned up my room to sleep in it.\n\nOne of my knuckles is fucked forever, and I will absolutely never have a cat ever again, but it was a great experience nonetheless.\n\nThe fucking end (I hope).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for not releasing Satan into the wild!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd tell your wife a stranger on reddit finds her precious for coping with it all!

{"prompt":"So about an hour and a half ago, I was asleep, and I heard my door open, and a girl walked in and got in bed with me, pulled the blanket over themselves, and passed out. I didn’t think much of it, because I have a friend who will occasionally just climb into my bed if she was out drinking with my roommates or whatever, so I just assumed it was her. \nI fell asleep for a bit, then woke up again and I could see this girls back, and she had a tattoo that I knew my friend didn’t have.

I really have no idea what to do in this situation.\n\nEdit!\nAlright so here’s what happened:\nAround the same time I made my reddit post, I posted in the group chat that has my housemates in it, basically just explaining everything I did in this post. Since it was so late I didn’t think they’d respond which is why i posted here in the first place, but one of them responded that she was a girl he’s been seeing recently, so I decided to wake her up after that, and he came down and got her. She was drunk, and I think she just got turned around in our house and ended up in the wrong room since she didn’t know the place very well. In any case, this girl turned out not to be a complete stranger, there were no sexual assault implications, and everything turned out fine, if a little bit awkward for everyone involved. \nAnd to clarify for those wondering, I live in a rented house in a college town, not a dorm, and we always make sure to lock up the house at night, which is why I assumed at first that she was my friend, let in by one of my roommates, and why I was extra confused when it turned out it wasn’t her lol.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You dont want someone with no recollection of the events to wake up naked in a strangers bed hours later.

I found out about this when I was 15 and I was pretty heartbroken about it, all I’ve ever wanted is to have kids, but I’m 19 now and I’ve accepted that there are other options and frankly, I’m excited to adopt or even foster. \n\nWell the last couple days, I’ve had this extreme loss of appetite and I am now 10 days late for my period, which isn’t unusual for me but the appetite thing caused me to take a test.

Abortion is an easy choice for me, and it’s legal and accessible where I live. \n\nBut there is one part of me that I cannot keep down, and that’s the part that’s telling me that this might be my only chance. I have no female friends to discuss this with and my family are judgemental to say the least. \n\nI’m scared that I’ll regret this. And I’m terrified that it’ll get my hopes up. And I feel so guilty.

I personally don’t want to put myself through nine months of physical and mental hell to not even end up with the kid.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Fellow PCOS-er here. It’s bullshit that you can’t get pregnant with PCOS. You can’t get pregnant with your hormones out of whack and unbalanced but you can get pregnant. \n\nMany of those same hormonal issues also play a role in endometriosis. \n\nYour doctor was wrong, as many of them are about women’s health and endocrine disease. Even the ob\/gyns and endocrinologists. \n\nIf you balance your hormones (diet and supplements and meds) you can certainly get pregnant. Lots of that going on in r\/pcos and r\/TTC_PCOS and I’m sure there are endometriosis ones too. \n\nI have PCOS and I ovulate and bleed every 38-45 days. I’ve used supplements to shorten that from 60-90. \n\nI have no reason to believe that I won’t be able to get pregnant when I’m ready. But I’ve also been on the balancing hormone track for a long time so I know what works and what I need to do. \n\nLupus is another story but low dose naltrexone can work wonders for autoimmune disorders. At 50mg naltrexone is used for opioid withdraws. At 4.5mg it acts almost in the opposite way. It down regulates your opioid receptors for 3-4 hours and then causes an endorphin spike that causes your body to kick up its anti-inflammatory response. \n\nIt can be a miracle for people with lupus. I broke my back when I was 24 and it’s been a miracle for pain relief for me. It’s also not only safe while pregnant, it’s encouraged because of its anti-inflammatory nature. \n\nMore at r\/lowdosenaltrexone \n\n\nSo all that to be said.....you most likely can get pregnant again. You can also do IVF. You could also bank your eggs and have a surrogate. And of course you can always adopt and foster. \n\n\nMake the choice that’s best for you right now without assuming you can’t ever get pregnant again. \n\nIt sounds like that’s an abortion. \n\nIf you want to be a mom, I’m 100% sure that universe can figure out how to make that happen for you in a way that satisfies your heart. \n\nMessage me if you want to talk privately. I’m happy to chat. \n\nMuch love to you. END"}

Thank you so much, there was no need for that but I really appreciate it.\n\nJust to give some context and because I need to let this out.... I was in a relationship with a person a between mid 2018 and mid 2019 and during the beginning everything was okay and quite beautiful but I knew that he had issues. I had my own issues as well but I had it under control as I was social and had lots of friends but then he wanted me to not get drunk or party or meet my friends. I couldn't dress the way I wanted to or wear make up. Talking about feminism was a no go. Watching Captain Marvel and hearing him say every two seconds that what Cap did wasn't natural for a woman, after so many months of being told that women this and women that, led me to break my own laptop in front of him. I was called abusive. I was suicidal. I felt alone. I didn't have anyone. I was isolated when I became his and he told me he wanted me to be his and I knew that his behavior was not okay but I thought I could have changed him.\n\nI know I was suicidal and as a result I caused him so much pain as a result but it was only because I had no contact with people anymore. I felt horrible. I could meet a guy friend but with another girl by my side, that's how he'd wanted it. Anyway he broke up with me because apparently he gave me enough time to change my views and I just didn't do it.\n\nI have never been the same again. I promised to myself that I would never allow anyone to hurt me as much as he did. I am no longer suicidal but this week hit me differently. Normally, I think of myself as a \"bad bitch\", it's a joke, but I am insecure and I own up to it because I know I have issues due to my childhood and the problems that my family caused me. I will get therapy, that is a promise. I can't right now because I moved into another country. But I am not the same person anymore since that relationship. I have a lot of internalized misogyny and I hate being a woman because I feel that as a woman I cannot contribute in any way to society despite that not being true and having so many role models. I feel like a failure. I want to be so strong and able to be good enough that... I can't. My boyfriend is my source of warm support and love and he is truly healthy. I have never met someone like him and that makes me not deserve him. That makes me feel guilty.\n\n\nThank you for your comments. I truly appreciate it. I will keep reading it for the next days.

{"prompt":"So my gf adopted this young outdoor cat who was always hanging on our porch a couple months ago. The cat is maybe a year old now and had been hanging out in this area since he was a kitten. When she went to get his shots done and a check up from the vet, the doc informed her that he had butthole damage. He had some sort of scarring on his butthole and we joked that he was a rape victim, but assumed it was most likely from doing something stupid outside or getting into a fight with another animal. He hangs out mostly inside but when he does go out he will sometimes come back with a red and inflamed butthole. We continued to brush it off. \n\nTwo days ago he was outside and we saw him walking around the side of our house. My gf, roommate, and I were watching him through the window when our old creepy nextdoor neighbor came out and started calling the cat over to him. The cat came up to him and he started to pet the cat a little bit then proceeded to pick him up and walk around behind a bush out of our sight. He was taller than the bush and had crouched down so we couldn’t see either of them at all behind it. Maybe 2 min later the old man emerges and cat out of sight. Old man glances at us and walks inside. Our cat comes back about an hour later and you wouldn’t believe it but his butthole was bright red and inflamed... That obviously looks suspect as hell right?? We haven’t let him outside since that as we are worried about his well being. And there really isn’t anything we could do about even if we knew he was being molested by our neighbor. Any advice on what we should do and if you think he is getting molested? Any cat butthole experts know what else it could be?\nWe are all kinda worried and got a bit of sick feeling in our stomachs from the whole thing..\n\nIs the old man molesting him or are we overreacting?\n\nAlso side note- this cat does not have a single care in the world, u could step on him and he’ll just lay there and accept it. If any cat were to be a rape victim cat it would be this one.\n\nEdit: any jokes i have made are not to be taken seriously. just tryna make a scary situation a little more easy to handle\/process.

{"prompt":"Jess 23f and I have been together for two years and she never liked my mom and with good reason because my mom is an alcoholic. My sister was placed into my care not too long ago. If I had not taken her, she would have been placed in the system. Jess never liked the idea and if I did not know any better, I would say that she was disappointed when I made the decision.\n\nShe wants us to have a baby and has been very vocal about it especially since my sister moved in. I am not particularly ready because I have a lot of responsibilities so it does not seem possible at the moment. I am juggling work and college on top of taking care of my sister. Jess still does not seem to understand that but I brushed it off as normal relationship differences.\n\nLast night I worked night shift and this morning, my sister was not herself at all. I took her out for ice cream and  tried getting her to talk and she eventually tearfully told me that she knows that I don't want her here. I asked her what gave her that idea and she explained to me that my fiance was telling her that we will soon have a baby of our own and start our own real family because that is what adults do. \n\nThere wouldn't be enough space for her because her room is supposed to be the baby's nursery so she might have to be taken back to my mom. I was so livid for many reasons but I tried not to show my sister. My mom was a functioning  alcoholic but got worse a while after I left home. Maybe because I took care of everything and everyone so now she had to be an actual parent. Anyway she would leave my sister alone for a day or two to go see her boyfriend. My sister would eventually have to call me and tell me the truth once the food ran out so I would have to drop everything and go down there. She generally tried to hide my mom's bad parenting.\n\nShe told  me the day I took her was the happiest day of her life and I have a very pink thank you bracelet to prove it. So it made me very mad to hear that Jess told her that she would go back. I explained to her that I want her here and nothing would ever change that. She has nothing to worry about and that Jess did not mean anything she said. She is not usually mean so it's so confusing for me.\n\nMy sister normally worships the ground Jess walks on but has been avoiding her today. I asked Jess about it and she did not deny. She said that my sister is not our responsibility and that she is ruining our plans to start a real family. I told her that my sister is in fact my responsibility and real family. I have no intentions of having a baby with her or get married if she can't respect that.\n\nShe freaked out and started shouting and calling my sister names saying it's all her fault. My sister must have heard because it's a tiny apartment. Because of this, I told her that she needs to leave my place and go calm down. We were planning on eloping but it's definitely off the books now.\n\nDid I make the right decision? And how do I reassure my sister especially after she heard what Jess said about her?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You care for your sister by removing Jess from both of your lives so that it's clear your sister can always rely on you.

I asked if she wanted to keep the car and she says no, she’ll buy one when she gets over there. So far so good.

{"prompt":"I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.\n\nI was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.\n\nEventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.\n\nFast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.\n\nThis is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.\n\nI just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good.

{"prompt":"To begin I am 17 years old my girlfriend is also 17. Recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about 2 weeks during that time I gave her one of my old phones so we could still communicate using snapchat. We have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. We both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. About 4 days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him. Today he asked her to text him what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. We checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the time when the phone wasn't in her position. There was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent. Her mom does not know and is away for the next 4 days in a foreign country. She is currently there alone with her stepdad. What should she do?\n\n\nUPDATE!!!.... She told her mom before she got back from said foreign country and her mom advised her to remain normal until she got back the next day. Her mom also made her stay at her grandma's house and when she got back she confronted her stepdad. Initially the stepdad denied it over and over but when her mom said she has proof he admitted to doing it and gave silly excuses why like saying \"he wanted to protect my gf\". My gf mom proceeded to kick him out and told him not to come back. He after hearing that he tried to stab himself with a screwdriver but her mom threatened to call the police and he left. It's been 2 days since that happened and he has continuously tried to guilt my gf mom and accused her of cheating soo he dosent look bad. Her mom is understandably devastated and completely confused (this was her Significant Other\/husband for over 10+ years) and she has since sought therapy for advice on how to proceed.

{"prompt":"A little backstory: \n\nMy brother and his two kids (4F & 16F) have been living with us for about 3 years now and since then he, along with his kids have managed to destroy my moms house little by little. The carpets needs to be redone, walls painted, and plumbing fixed. I have been away at University for the past 3 years (back during semester breaks) so I haven't had the chance to witness all that was done over the years first hand. However, now with COVID-19 and social distancing I have spent a little more time at home than I would like to in this environment.\n\nAside from that, my mom decided it was necessary for him to pay rent each month for the upkeep of the house, especially since she does the shopping for groceries, and also has to pay for any of the maintenance done to the house. After that deal was implemented my brother has barely paid her and when he is confronted about it, he will get mad and say she's overbearing or asking of too much. Personally, I think it is very reasonable but that's just my two cents.\n\nWell today (about 30 minutes ago) she told him he had to move out and gave him a 30 day notice. After she told him, he went downstairs to the basement where he sleeps and started slamming a bunch of doors and cursing at my mom about how she is going to go to hell and the family hates her etc. etc. (we don't btw). But my concern is that with his bad temper and a 30 day window, I fear for my mom's safety. I am home all the time and I can fight my brother if need be, especially if he lays a finger on our mom but, I know that is not the best way to go about the situation. I texted my mom as soon as he started his episode that I should call the cops but she said no because \"he will get in trouble\". I told her to at least put her pride aside and lock her door as well as put something in front of it tonight just to be safe.\n\nI don't know when he's going to move out but this safety precaution damn sure can't go on every night, and I am not going to wait for things to escalate and my brother do physical harm to my mom. What should I do in this situation? Calling the cops would mean that something would need to happen but I don't want to be reactive I want to be proactive.

{"prompt":"I've (19m) been with my girlfriend (19) for a year and a half now, and for the first time last week, she woke up screaming bloody murder. It was about 2:30 am. I turned over as I was trying to get comfortable, like I do when I'm trying to sleep every night, and it's like she heard it in her sleep and her body freaked out. She started to crawl over me like she was trying to escape the room and started screaming. Loudest I've ever heard her, and shes a loud person. Took like 5-10 seconds to get her sto stop. She started crying after, but not during - this was a pure, horrified scream, no sobbing between breathes. \n\nAfterwards, she was terrified. Of everything. She thought there was something under the bed, she had me check the whole room. She's scared of the dark, but it doesn't affect her when she sleeps. After this, for the rest of the night, she needed the TV on. We stayed up for a few hours, and I tried talking with her. It felt like every other thing I said scared the crap out of her, and caused her to cry. \n\nFor a few days after, she didn't scream, but she would wake up suddenly a few times, similar to when she screamed; only difference is, instead of a scream, she just breathed really heavily and fast and was scared. I would hold her and talk to her for a few minutes and she would calm back down. \n\nA good 5-6 days have gone by since the scream, and just an hour ago, about 6:30, she screamed again. She had her alarm go off for work at 6:00, and we were laying there, half asleep, for about 30-45 minutes before she needed to get up - pretty typical.. (I thought this was pretty funny, but still) I farted and it sent her off. It's not unusual for me to fart in bed when I'm half asleep, but for some reason this one scared her. She started screaming again. This one was reasonably shorter, 3-4 seconds maybe, and she didn't try crawling over me again. However, everything else was the same. She needed me to walk her to the bathroom, walk her to her car, and half of the things I said seemed to scare her. The weird part is it was perfectly light out, and she was just as scared.\n\nShe talks about how after this happens, she always feels like something's going to get her, usually from the shadows. She knows nothings there, but she can't will herself to not be scared. \n\nAny idea what this is, and any possible treatments for it? Or any ideas for how I can best prevent it \/ make her feel calm when it happens? She hasn't been diagnosed or treated, but she for sure suffers from some form of anxiety, and possibly minor PTSD from her rough childhood. \n\n(These screams are taking a toll on me and are starting to make me nervous to go to bed as well. It's like watching a movie and knowing theres going to be a jump scare) \n\nTL;DR my girlfriend has suddenly started walking up screaming, with no history of doing so.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the kind support! We have a doctors visit scheduled tomorrow to hopefully see what the matter is. We both suspect its night terrors. I'll update you guys after our visit. Thank you again!\n\nEdit 2: went to the doctor, shes going to be alright.

About 10 seconds later when I opened the door my dad closed the TV and laid there in silence with a TV that was turned off, and didn't say anything when I was microwaving my food. I didn't say anything too, because I was shocked, confused and disgusted at the same time. This all happened about an hour ago.\n\nI haven't ever been abused by my mom or dad, in any way or form.

{"prompt":"We were together for two years and I decided to end the relationship yesterday. I ended it because of a few reasons. The biggest reason is because of his anger issues. If I didn’t do or say exactly what he wanted me to, he would get extremely angry (yelling at the top of his lungs, throwing objects, push me, etc) and say hurtful things. I know you are thinking “why did she stay with this guy?”. I would ask myself the same thing over and over but still find myself wanting to stay because I wanted to believe these things would just work itself out. Six months ago, the arguing and fights began to intensify and I started to resent him. Two weeks ago we were in the car and he was criticizing me over a situation I was venting to him about, so I asked him why he always had to critique everything I did (no yelling on my part). He exploded in anger, told he was so angry he wanted to punch me in the face and tried to push me out of the car in the middle of the street with moving traffic. We ended up pulling over in a parking lot and I got out the car to walk on my own because I was scared and couldn’t believe what was happening. As I started walking off, he gets out of his car and walks into the middle of the road with oncoming traffic and refused to get out of the street until I personally removed him. Cars braked rapidly and there was a lot of honking, while I am crying and pulling this man out of the road. I called a mutual friend of ours who can usually help call him down, and he did. He promised me for the millionth time he wasn’t going to yell at me again and act out, I decided to let it slide once again. However, I didn’t really let it slide because I kept replaying that scene over and over again in my head. Last week he yelled at me in the middle of a Dave & Busters over a parking spot, in front of everyone. I have begged him to go to therapy with me and he says it’s a waste of money and that no therapist knows what they’re talking about, \n\nToday, I decided that I needed to end the relationship for good. I wasn’t happy anymore and his anger had officially pushed me over the edge. I couldn’t even look at him the same way anymore. I told him everything I was feeling and I figured he would be really upset. He once again promised things would change and to give him a chance, begging me to stay. It hurt but I knew it was the right thing to do. I stood firm and said I no longer wanted to be with him. He started sending me text messages saying he was going to kill himself because of the breakup. I immediately got him on the phone and it just kept getting worse. I tried my best to calm him down but all he wanted to hear was that I would take him back. I didn’t want to lie to him and couldn’t give a false promise and he didn’t take that well. I decided to call his mother because I was afraid he would actually hurt himself. I was at my dad’s house while this was happening and he ended up going to my apartment (he has a key) to see if he would run into me, He then sent me text messages with pictures of him holding a suicide note and telling me that he loved me but he was done living if he couldn’t have me. He ended up taking a bunch of pain killers and was drinking alcohol. My roommate found him in my bathroom barely able to stay awake. I rushed home while they called 911. Thankfully, we got him help at the right time and they were able to treat him for the OD. He is now at the hospital on a three day suicide watch. I stayed at the ER until his mother arrived and I spoke to him for a few minutes. He was hazy and crying, it broke my heart even more. I decided to leave to give him some space to rest and clear his head. \n\nI am battling these feelings that it’s my fault and I shouldn’t have broken up with him. Everyone tells me it’s not but I cant help feeling this way. I am overwhelmed. When I got home, I found the suicide note he wrote me. He had left his bank information and said he was leaving me all his money, and to donate his organs. I don’t even know what to feel or what to do right now. I am still in shock. Have I really been in a toxic relationship for two years? How did I let it get this bad? What is wrong with me? I want to visit him in the hospital to be there for him as a friend but I am not sure if that is a good idea, I don’t know what to do. It feels like a bad dream.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Have you been in a toxic relationship for years? Yes\n\nHow did I let it get this bad? Women don’t fall in love with abusive men. They fall in love with men who become abusive. So, he moved the bar slowly into more and more abusive and you didn’t notice until it was really bad because he’s also either directly telling or implying that you don’t deserve better. \n\nWhat is wrong with me? Nothing. However, to believe that a man abusing you is somehow something wrong with you means you’ve fully absorbed his lesson that you’re the problem not him.\n\nDon’t visit him in the hospital. Don’t ever communicate with him again. He only attempted suicide to manipulate you. He already had your full attention when he did it so he could be pretty sure he wouldn’t die. Ignore him forever.\n\nI’m 100% serious when I say you should literally move because when he finds out he can’t contact you; he’ll seek you so hard that things will be the worst they’ve ever been.\n\nYou should google “domestic violence, emotional abuse” and read every page until it starts to sound like this is what he did to you and you’re upset about it. You should seek out community resources for victims of domestic abuse. You should seek therapy to help you recover. Your community may have free, low cost therapy available for victims of domestic violence. I wouldn’t say you need a shelter at this point. GET YOUR LOCKS CHANGED BEFORE THE THREE DAYS ARE UP!\n\nThis is dangerous for you; forget trying to make him feel better and protect yourself. END"}
{"prompt":"There's been a man tapping at my window every night for a week now. Every time I go over to the window I see him skulking away. It is now 5:30 AM and I was woken up by him tapping at my window. I called the police and they couldn't do anything because nobody could find him. What should I do?\n\nEdit: Okay, so I'm getting many responses about firearms. This is definitely not something I'm interested in doing for multiple reasons.\n\nEdit 2: Hey everyone. I've been looking into a few things. So first and foremost, we all know that everything is half shut down right now, especially for me, since I live in NYC and this city is a hotspot for ther virus. Because of this, many places are closed, I can't exactly order anything which will get here in time for tonight. I'm planning on going to home depot to see if I can find anything I'm looking for.nIn the meantime, I've talked to my friend and me and him are going to wait outside my apartment tonight with an extra bright flashlight and see if this man shows up again. I want to be on the offensive. I will update later tonight or tomorrow if anything happens.\n\nEdit 3: So some of you are saying my plan is a bad idea, which... is probably true now that I think about it. If he has a gun and I'm unarmed this could end very badly for me, especially if we startle him with a flashlight. Some of you suggested putting a sign on my window. I am going to do this. My new plan is to wait outside with my friend like before, after putting the sign on my window. If this person comes by and is undeterred I will phone the police while keeping a safe distance across the street with my friend. Again, will update if anything happens.\n\nUPDATE! - I am currently waiting across the street with my friend. We are planning to spend the entire night here. We have beef jerky and breath of the wild on my switch to keep us occupied. Wish us luck.\n\nFINAL UPDATE! - Whoever guessed that a drug dealer used to live in my apartment is right. The guy who was tapping my window came by as expected around 4:30 last night. Me and my friend decided he didn't look too threatening so we confronted him! I asked him why he's been coming by for the last 4 nights. He told me he was looking for Seon with the edibles... I'm not sure what happened to Seon with the edibles. Nobody had been living here for like a year before I moved in. Anyway... That about sums up this mystery.

Get liquid ass from amazon and spray it outside your window\n\n2.  Make it uncomfortable as possible to be outside your window.  Can you put allumium foil held down by rocks right underneath your window so it would make a lot of noise if he got close?  What about something else equally obnoxious? \n\n3.  Go to the hardware store and buy the \"smile! you're on camera\" signs and similar, see if that scares him off.  \n\n4.  Put your phone against the window (or an old phone) and see if that scares him off\n\n5.  Can you buy a motion activated water sprayer?\n\n6.  One of the best ways to scare people off -**battery powered motion activated outdoor light.  Movement= his area becomes illuminated and he no longer feels safe.**  Buy them on amazon. \n\n7.  You can also buy a **hunting battery operated motion activated camera**.  They are relatively low cost and you could probably strap it to anything.

{"prompt":"Just some background to this. I’ve worked hard for ten years. I’ve never not had a job and I supported my ex husband financially pretty comfortably when he rarely worked and would stay at home and play WoW.\n\nI’m in a new relationship now and it’s leading down the road of marriage, family etc. \n\nEvery serious relationship I’ve had I’ve been the breadwinner, same is true for my current relationship: he’s a student and picks up casual work from time to time however this is the last year of his masters and I really want a break. Namely to write, study, sew and do whatever the hell I need to do to destress and hopefully start a family. (I’ve been battling fertility issues also) \n\nWe’ve talked about it and he’s actually excited to have all his meals cooked for him by me, the house way more organised than it is now, having someone to welcome him home and have all his errands done for him. I shared this with friend and she really put me down about essentially wanting to be a 50s housewife but I’ve argued I’ll also be studying or finishing a novel. Possibly even volunteering if I can find the right position.\n\nBasically when my partner gets a full time job we will be in a good financial position as he will earn a lot more than I am now (my income is pretty modest as I don’t have any degrees). The way I see it is it’s a chance to also study and better myself but she has said she “needs time to think about the future of our relationship” all because she says “you’re a misogynistic woman and setting women back 100 years” I don’t know how to make her see it from my perspective.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You're not setting women back and you're doing what you want to do.  That is feminism imo.  You are setting your own goals and your own path.  Your partner isn't setting them for you.

{"prompt":"I am only posting here, because the original post was here.  So many, many people responded; I wanted to reach the same audience and let everyone know what their advice did, and the results.  The original post:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/9z2jff\/my_brother_who_hated_religion_died_saturday_i\/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nSome background:\n\nIn his last week of life, Brother was moved to our sister's house (who is an active nurse).  She selflessly accepted him in (despite two children and a work schedule that ICU\/ER nurses have), and kept a \"baby monitor\" in the room; she was always available, cleaned him, turned him, etc... all of the needs that a dying person has, that only others whose family members are on the verge of dying can understand.\n\nI followed the more or less general consensus, and was preparing to create a coalition to protest a funeral so very much against who my brother was in life.\n\nAnd in my outrage... *I* somehow forgot who my brother was in life.\n\nI got a call from our Sis.  She wanted to check up on me, knowing how devastated I was by Brother's death.\n\nIn all of my anger, in all of my outrage... I never called the one person who had been caring for him.\n\nBrother foresaw our mother's pain, and agreed to a Roman Catholic burial.  He did not convert as I thought I was being told, or whatever the case may have been.\n\nSis did not believe it either, but assured me that she made sure they were alone, and spoke to him during a lucid period to verify that he actually agreed to it.\n\nThat was the kind of man my brother was.  In his very last days, as he lay dying, he cared more about how the pain and loss after he was gone would affect others, rather than about himself.\n\nI actually *was* the asshole, for only dwelling in my own pain and not realizing that this is exactly something Brother would do: \"sacrifice\" himself for the good of others.  Sacrifice is too strong a word, but you know what I mean.\n\nSo:  I officially thank the hundreds upon hundreds who took the time to comment, and the dozens who PM'd\/DM'd me.  All of you, in all of your thoughts and beliefs on every side... again, thank you.  Brother and I always believed in hearing all sides without reservation.\n\nYou have -beyond doubt- shown that that caring towards others still holds true despite all of the hate and fingerpointing that currently seems so prevalent.\n\nA forum of complete strangers came together.  I love you all... and thank you so very, very much.\n\nI have on last thing to ask of you:\n\nDo a random act of kindness for a complete stranger, just once.\n\nI don't mean some faceless donation to charity or whatever, to some random whatever.  Instead, make a difference, if even for a moment, to some other person around you.  For no reason other than to brighten someone's day.\n\nGive a bag to someone who is short one at a checkout stand at your local grocery.  Offer to buy someone's coffee in line behind you. Help someone to cross a street, or offer to lead someone lost somewhere in a hospital. *Something*\n\nBecause these are the kind of things my brother did every day.  And if you happened to say -or even just think to yourself- \"Because Jeremy OB Wright no longer can, let me help you\"... then there could never be any better memorial for him than that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm glad you were able to find peace with what is going on.

{"prompt":"I’m new to Reddit and I made this account so I can get some help . I’ve been dating my gf for 1 year now and i really need advice on what to do. Her family is illegal and her dad left when she was in 6th grade she has told me about Her brother being a pervert and I need advice on what to do here’s some of the things he has done\n\n1. She has told me about multiple times he has told her to play fight\/wrestle which is normal but when they do he grabs her by the waist or stomach and holds her against his crotch or he has tried to bend her over. She told me they have play fought before when they were younger and nothing happened but around 2 years ago is when he started doing weird stuff like that. I think it was bc she was going through puberty around 13 like most people do so he saw her more sexually now.\n\n2. He also has walks in on her while she is changing. she changes every time she gets home from school and he has to give her a ride back home most days. I know that this could be a accident but I promise I’m not exaggerating it when I say it was a every day thing and I know he knows what he is doing and she knows as well that’s why she tells me. \n\n3. He also has gone into her room while my gf was laying down comfortably with no shirt and no bra because she thought she was only home with her mom and sister after seeing him she held a blanket on her but then he asked if she was wearing a shirt my gf responded by telling him to get out and then he got up and took of her blanket \n\n4. Since her family is illegal only her brother and sister can work but since her sister really doesn’t work at all her brother is the one that has to work but he uses that to take advantage of her. He has told her that if she doesn’t give him a hug he will stop paying her phone bill and recently while I was spending time with her and her mom they found out they can check when to get a upgrade on there phone plan and when they were looking at it in the car they saw that her brother has been lying to them the whole time and could’ve got her a new phone but instead kept lying and saying that it’s not ready yet just so he has something to control her with and I’m not lying either because her mom called her brother and asked him and he hung up on her mom\n\n5. He also talks to her like a guy trying to flirt with a girl. He has told her that she is thicker then a snicker while I was on the phone with her and he always try’s to take her out to eat or get her to hang out with him \n\nI know this is long but I really need help I’m only a sophomore in high school with my gf who is in the same grade as me and I’m worried about her safety. we have broken up before because I have been really intense when it came to her being around him or anyone  and i got kinda toxic because I didn’t trust anyone in her family we got back together after a couple days . I finally got her to ask her mom for a lock on her door and she got one two days ago but it’s a really cheap one that you can still see a little crack in the door but it’s better then nothing. \n\nI know it’s not the best typed but I’m just really scared and sad I need help I love this girl and I don’t want to lose her she makes me happy and I don’t want her to get hurt and she refuses to tell her mom because her mom already has a lot of stress which I can understand but I can’t keep living with this regret that I haven’t done anything about it\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Is there no way for your own family to have her over more often? and more often... more often...  \n  \nuntil she's all but moved in.  \n  \nNot a bizarre concept for HS couples that have been together long enough.

{"prompt":"After a job interview I had today, I'm just dwelling on this presumption that the interviewers don't like me. But I can't really justify why. I feel the same way about a lot of people that I know. I just get the 'vibe' that they think of me a certain way.\n\nFor context, I am a 22yo female, studying at university and working. \n\nIn some situations I have justification for why I think they don't like me, for example, my ex boyfriend made it his mission to tell all our mutual friends all the horrible things I allegedly did. \n\nIn other situations, I may have only talked to the person a handful of times, but still feel they think I am slightly distasteful for reasons x, y and z - despite no reason for them to really think that.\n\nSometimes I even think my sisters don't like me, yet we talk every day.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? Why do you think this happens and how do I stop myself believing it so much?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In psychology, this is called a “self-fulfilling prophecy.” When you believe something is true, you act as though it is true. Meaning, since you have been dispositioned to believe people don’t like you based on previous experience, you automatically get that vibe from others. A lot of the time it is probably irrational, as you mentioned.\n\nEven in your example with your ex, it doesn’t mean that people actually felt that way about you. Often our feelings that we think other people have are just a reflection of how we see ourselves. An example of this would be if you trip and fall in public. You will probably assume that people think you’re dumb, clumsy, or that something is inherently wrong with you. However, there are many possibilities that someone seeing you trip would think such as “is she okay?”\n\nSince you’re aware that this is irrational behavior, you can begin to fix the problem. Most of the time, this stems from your self-esteem. If you have a low self-esteem, you are more likely to feel this way often. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help work through these thoughts by offering a justification and resolution to negative irrational thoughts. However, that’s not always an option for people. There are infinite resources on self-fulfilling prophecies, negative self-talk, and other principles that people commonly feel. YouTube and Google searches can give you a lot of insight (or at least help you understand this is a common occurrence in most people). Hopefully that helps you understand why this happens a bit better. Feel free to ask more questions or for clarification! Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Autocorrect fixed for context clarity. END"}

{"prompt":"So backstory: I (22F) went to college for Engineering, a course they forced me to take when I really wanted to do art. I was still dead set on making it with art even if I had to do it on my own so I worked hard and self studied and eventually I guess I got good enough for professional work. Now, for my course, after graduating you need take a licensure exam to be considered a professional which I really don’t want and I think it’s a huge waste of time when my plan doesn’t involve doing Engineering for the rest of my life. However, my parents really think there’s big money in it (despite many people saying otherwise). \n\nFast forward to now, I’ve been offered a job as a Concept Artist for a game studio and the pay is pretty good as a starting salary and after some research, it’s more than the starting salary for Engineers. My mom, of course, doesn’t believe this because she only listens to her officemates who probably has a friend of a cousin of a friend (or whatever the fuck) who makes pretty good money. I’m perfectly aware that that’s possible but I’m shit at Engineering; Art is what I’m good at and they won’t accept it.\n\nAnother reason she’s so against it is because the healthcare benefit doesn’t cover them so of course this job is no use to HER and she even said that herself. Apparently, my siblings are both married so it’s my job to cover them and sacrifice what I want in life to cater to them. All I’m thinking is this is a stepping stone for me, finally getting my foot through the door to the industry and it sucks not being supported every step of the way. \n\nIm 85% certain I’m taking the job but I’m having second thoughts because they make me feel so guilty. How do I make them understand?\n\nEdit : Hello, thank you to everyone who replied. All your encouragements are really uplifting and I’m getting more and more confident to take the job. \n\nI do just want to say (because some are kinda bordering on offensive). I understand the point a few of you are trying to get across, that I’m already an adult and why am I even asking this but I just want to say that I live in a culture that is very family-oriented and it’s expected of us (and basically ingrained) to be the “safety net”. I only graduated last year and we are in the middle of a pandemic so it makes things harder to just cut ties or fuck em no matter how much I want to. Till this pandemic is over, I’m stuck with them till the foreseeable future and I’m unfortunately still dependent on them for food and shelter. \nAgain, I do understand your point but I just wanna clear this up.\n\nEdit : I took the job ☺️ I sent the signed offer and now I'm just waiting for the right moment to tell them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Holy shit, take the job.

I understand her perspective and I just had a moment of weakness. \n\nWhen we said yes to having her here, we were straight out of the foster classes. Literally, just got the certification 2 days prior. But we still just... had a feeling that we could NOT say no when we were explained her dire situation.

Having her here has given this household some of this best times and that can’t be replaced. Does it get hard? Yes. But hearing her caseworkers say how much happier she seems when she is here and how much she has actually been able to be a kid... that stuff makes it worth it.

Even now my brother and sister who have been with us for 8 years still show some of those symptoms. Sometimes we forget where they came from, what limited options they were given. Something that also helped was small incentives, such as behave well and we'll take you to go see a movie, or we'll go for some fro yo, things kids their age enjoy.

He didn’t need to be dropped, he was desperately clinging to his support system. \n\n\n\nWhen I made my initial post almost everyone said to drop E and run away from the whole situation. That felt wrong to me. Instead I got the people that he loves the most together to talk about his behavior. I didn’t think that someone who was reacting to things the way that he was could possibly be in a good mental state, and I was afraid for my friend. \n\nFirst, I contacted R and and him if he was actually interested in being romantically involved with me. He was. So we set up a time for the two of us, to sit down with E and his girlfriend to talk about why he got so angry seeing R and I together. \n\nIt was a long conversation with lots of question dodging and tears, but in the end we started to unravel things a little bit. Here’s the basic summary:\n\nE and R’s dad left their mom when they were both very young. He stayed in contact with them until he got married. E was 13 and hasn’t spoken to his father since then. E never received more than a few days of therapy for this. (And this is when he started having outbursts of anger).  They have another brother, L, who is a few years older than R. (Never mentioned him before because that original post was long enough and he was irrelevant). L became like a father figure to R and E after their actual dad cut contact. Then L got married about a year ago, and moved out off the house they lived in together, and became much more distant. Making E and R even closer. \n\nL didn’t leave entirely but E still felt like he lost a branch of his support system. Since L got married E’s mental health has been steadily getting worse. He was always prone to both anxiety attacks and depressive episodes in the past. Never diagnosed with anything officially because he wouldn’t go to a doctor, but when L became distant those things started getting much worse. E tried to keep it from everyone because he didn’t want anyone to worry. His girlfriend noticed a change, but E insisted to her that he was fine. \n\nYou’re probably sensing a pattern in E’s life. Someone he cares about gets married, and stops being in contact with him. After some talking we found out that lots of E’s panic attacks are triggered by a fear (no matter how illogical) of losing people. \n\nAfter a long time insisting that we still loved him and we were there because we loved him, E finally told us why he freaked out at Friendsgiving.  When he saw R and I kiss he suddenly panicked, thinking that he was about to lose both his best friend and his brother to a relationship. In his mind the only way to keep us around was to make sure we didn’t date, and his reaction was the incident you read in the original post. \n\nE acknowledges that the way he acted was toxic, abusive,  and a bad way to handle the situation. He also said that he doesn’t mind if R and I date, and he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me. After much debate we finally convinced him to get a therapist and to stop drug use. To try it for at least for six months. He seems like he’s ready to get better. \n\nOverall I’m saying that while there is no hope in some situations you should still try to talk to people who are behaving erratically. There’s probably a reason they’re doing it. They may even know what the reason is. A cry for help doesn’t always sound like one. If your friends act in a way that is abnormal and negative, don’t immediately run away, try to help. If I had run away my best friend, who was already spiraling, would have been in a position that was so much worse.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is a good lesson for people, there may be something deeper going on that what is being displayed. \n\nGood on you for being a good friend.

{"prompt":"I thought I would just post a quick update in regards to [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/l9deas\/strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\\_neighbour\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/l9deas\/strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs_neighbour\/)\n\nThanks for your advice everyone.\n\nSo I have been keeping the recordings. On the next evening, I contacted the police saying I was concerned about her behaviour not that I was complaining about the nuisance. They advised me to contact Lewisham Environmental Health Office, as it was late I didn't really think about it but the next day I realised someone was just fobbing me off, what has it got to do with EHO? So I didn't bother\n\nOver the next few days, it escalated, becoming more frequent so I contacted them again only to be told they have noted it down but there is nothing they can do at this stage but to keep informing them. It continued to escalate that day, getting more violent [http:\/\/dropshare.rebelinblue.com\/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ\/](http:\/\/dropshare.rebelinblue.com\/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ\/) so I contacted them at 10pm and they said they would report it to the Safer Neighbour Team who would contact me.\n\nThe next day they turned up, although there was some confusion because even though I have a SE26 postcode which is Sydenham I am actually in Forest Hill (looked it up and the boundary literally runs down the middle of the road so one side is Sydenham the other Forest Hill). I showed them the footage, including videos at 2am and 4am and they agreed that it is creepy and concerning, they asked if I wanted them to speak to her but said it possibly wasn't a good idea until they can report it to the correct Neighbourhood Team as it may make things escalate further. I agreed. So they gave me the contact details for the Forest Hill team and asked me to email them the videos.\n\nBefore I got round to it I got a phone call from the team just confirming how to get to the flat (it is a bit of a PITA to find) but as I was out I said they may not be able to get in as the front door is normally locked and I am the only one with a doorbell.\n\nWe agreed that they would talk to her as if there was a concern for her rather than about her. They phoned me back in the afternoon and said they had spoken to her and she seemed normal if maybe a bit slow, she denied knocking on the door and they said they had seen footage to which she said she was just knocking to chat and they told her it was not appropriate at 4 in the morning. At this stage, I think they assumed I was probably someone just complaining about a noisy neighbour and she maybe wasn't very bright and hadn't realised the problem with knocking at 4 in the morning. But they asked me to send them the videos so I sent a couple of choice highlights like the one above and one of her racing up the stairs doing it and racing back down... I got back the reply \"OK Yeah, those videos speak for themselves don't they!\"\n\nThey concluded, like I had, that she was unwell so referred the case to social services. They advised that maybe she was sleepwalking and that I should maybe get a stair gate for now. I said I didn't want to because I was worried that if she was sleepwalking she may try and climb over and hurt herself but I would keep it under advisement.\n\nTuesday night she kept me up most of the night, then again Wednesday night, I missed work yesterday due to lack of sleep. At this point I thought \"fuck it I really don't care if she hurts herself now\" so brought a stair gate... but I am not an arsehole so did look for one wide enough to go on the landing so that if she fell she wouldn't fall down the stairs but unfortunately the only one I could find was 4 to 6 weeks delivery so settled for one on the top of the stairs. I also contacted the officier again to ask if there was any news and he said once it had been referred it was out of their hands so he had no idea but said I might want to report it again and consider a harassment report.\n\nI informed the freeholder than I was installing a gate at the advice of the police and his response was simply \"OK thanks\".\n\nYesterday I was out at the shop over the road and she came in, she left before me and after I came out she came running across the road saying she had locked herself out of her flat and could she wait in mine, obviously there was no chance so I made up a lie about just doing some shopping then going to a meeting so I put my shopping away and went out for a walk. By the time I was back someone had come with the key thankfully.\n\nI installed the stairgate last night when it arrived.\n\nShe didn't knock overnight but I am 99% sure that is a pure coincidence as the camera would have caught her coming up the stairs... Literally, as I said this to a colleague she came up the stairs, climbed over and banged on the door.\n\nIt slowed her down enough for me to get to the door to confront her but she just ignored me. A few minutes later she came out and opened the gate. So I went out and put a bike lock on it to see what happened.\n\nHalf an hour later the camera has her coming out, checking to see if I was there then realising there is something on the gate so examining it, then when I came out she legged it. That was enough evidence for the police to finally take it seriously, sleepwalking people don't check to see if anyone is watching them or stop to examine locks so they are sending someone out today but said to phone back immediately if she becomes aggressive.\n\nShe's been back to look at it a few times so far.\n\nExhausting!\n\nUPDATE 1 (Friday afternoon): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gn34jav\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gn34jav\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 2 (Friday evening): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gn48zsm\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gn48zsm\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 3 (Saturday morning): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gn5ndlc\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gn5ndlc\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 4 (Saturday afternoon): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gn8wwml\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gn8wwml\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 5 (Saturday evening): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gnbm7u6\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnbm7u6\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 6 (Sunday morning): https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/_\/gned9gf\/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 7 (Sunday evening): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\/gnhb4vq\/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnhb4vq\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nMAJOR UPDATE 8 (Monday morning):  https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/_\/gnily1x\/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 9 (Monday evening): https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/_\/gnkxn86\/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 10 (Tuesday morning): https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnmtket\n\nUPDATE 11 (Tuesday afternoon): https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnn1fza?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 12 (Wednesday morning): https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnr7vkw\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 14 (Thursday morning): https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/_\/gnv4igd\/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 15 (Thursday lunchtime): Hopefully the final update https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnvn9vo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 16 (Friday morning): Final update https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gnzduqg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 17 (Friday evening): Final update for real this time\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/go13jpw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 18 (Monday evening): So maybe it's not over... https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/goec3io?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 19 (Tuesday evening): It has gone to court, so here are the insane videos\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/goi80m7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 20 (Thursday evening): https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/li84c6\/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs\/gorbjvl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That's crazy.

{"prompt":"Posting on a second account as my husband knows the username of my main account. Please read the whole post if you have the time.\n\nI will have been married to my husband for three years next month. Been together for six years total. Like all couples, we’ve had our ups and downs but he is the love of my life. Since the beginning of our relationship, I have always told him how family was very important to me and that being a mother was my ultimate life goal. I’ve always wanted nothing more than to have children, give them the best life I could give them, and protect them with all that I have. He knew this and agreed that family and children are a big deal for him as well. But we wanted to wait until we were done with our education and stable before we pursued having children.\n\nEarly November, we decided to start TTC (Trying to Conceive) and this is when things started taking a turn. We agreed that though we are trying for a baby, we still wanted to make the sex exciting and didn’t want it to feel like a chore. So we decided to start trying new kinks and fetishes to make things fresh and fun. Mid-summer, he expressed he wanted to try out DDLG. For this kink, he would be the daddy and I would be the little girl. My roles consisted of wearing pacifiers, children’s girl underwear, and to talk like a baby while he would talk like a parent calling me “princess” and “babygirl”. He would also mention my intimate area as “princess parts”. Thought I thought it was an interesting kink, I didn’t complain and just went with it.\n\nWell he ended up liking the role-play so much that it became a common occurrence and he wanted to do DDLG at least two or three times a week because he “loved the lifestyle”. Again, strange but I was so busy with life and tracking my cycles that I pushed it off. Then comes January. He expressed that he wants to try out incest role-play. The main roles he wanted to try out were Mother\/Son and Father\/Daughter. I honestly wasn’t okay with this one and expressed this to him, but he convinced me that it was to just add spice and keep things fun. So I went along with it. But this morning everything changed. My husband has a habit of falling asleep to Youtube videos or Twitch streams so he often wakes up with his phone on low battery since it’s just on all night. I woke up this morning (I’m usually up before him) to see that his phone screen was on while he was asleep. So I picked it up to put it on the charging stand and on his phone, I saw porn. The video that he had finished watching was a Father Daughter incest porn video. I opened up his Safari history and saw that he had been viewing just father and daughter incest porn since around the time we started the DDLG role-play.\n\nMaybe it’s extreme but I am considering a divorce because I can not imagine having a child with my husband with everything I’ve found. I feel bad but I can not continue this relationship if we can’t have children sometime in the future. And right now I’m unsure of having children with him. As I said, being a mother means everything to me and I would hate to put my children in a dangerous situation. It would hurt me if I found out that my child got harmed and it was partly due to my poor choices. I recognize that watching a certain porn doesn’t mean you would actually do these things but it’s evident he’s been really into this for awhile and he gets so passionate whenever we role-play scenarios where he plays a father figure and I play his child. It’s scaring me.\n\nTLDR; My husband has been fixated on incest-related kinks when we’re trying to have a baby and it’s making me consider divorce.\n\nEdit: I have decided I’m going to proceed with a divorce. I just don’t think there’s any coming back from this and my future kids are too important to me. I can’t afford to gamble on something so serious, as I could potentially help be the cause of some life changing damage and trauma. I think it would be best for us to go our separate ways. I will always love him and I wish him the best, just not with me. Thanks everyone for your thoughts.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Use the baby voice when you tell him you want a divorce. END"}
{"prompt":"Backstory:\nMy parents wanted me and my brother to stay at their house over night for Xmas eve. My girlfriend has trouble sleeping alone so I decided to take her with me for the night.\n\nNow, my GF and my brother had had a weird relationship a while back and he was manipulative enough that she developed some strange tendencies about him, similar to that of an abusive relationship.\n\nThe Event: My GF and I are going to sleep. I pass out and wake up 15 minutes later to the sound of distant moaning. I get out of bed and the hair stands up on the back of my neck as I realize that my GF is not in my room. I sneak out into the hallway and I hear my GF giggling and laughing from my brothers room. I hear her whisper “be careful”.\n\nI march straight into my brothers room where I find my brother pretending to be asleep (but still obviously breathing heavily) and my GF laying next to him. She still has her clothes on and she acts like nothing is going on but she’s being a little defensive.\n\nI ask her what happened and she eventually admits that he had kissed her. She also later admits that she was moaning because he was touching her. She started off saying that she stopped him as soon as she could and that she only went in there to talk to him. I brought up that she could have left a lot sooner and that I could hear her moaning and she admired that she didn’t intend for things to get sexual, but she did let it happen because she still had feelings for him.\n\nGF drove back home in the middle of the night and I soon did the same, sending my parents a quick heads up explaining why I left.\n\nPresent:\nNow I’m getting texts from both my parents saying that they are sad that I left and that family should stick together. My mom said that she’s sorry I got caught up between my brother and GF which makes me feel like she didn’t respect my relationship with her and that it was always more about her and y brother.\n\nThey want me to hear my brothers side of the story. He has a history of using women and my parents usually respond with “he’s just not a relationship guy” even though he uses obvious manipulation tactics.\n\nI really thought my parents would have my back on this one. Why does it feel like they care less about my situation and just want me to forgive my brother so we can have a normal Christmas?\n\nWhat do I do?!\n\nUpdate: Turns out my brother never made a move and she was the one trying to start shit. We’ve been together for almost a year now and I had no idea she was manipulating me the whole time. Feels like a mind-fucky plot twist at the end of a movie. My brain is inside out.\n\nFinal update:\nI am absolutely dumping my GF. I recommended that she get psychiatric help because she shows some big signs of BPD. However, I also made it clear that what she did was unforgivable. No coming back from that.\n\nIt’s also apparent that both the GF and my brother were lying about what actually happened. There’s no reason for her to confess to messing around with him if it didn’t happen; odds are, my brother is lying about being innocent in the matter.\n\nFor my family’s sake, I will try to get along with him on holidays, but I absolutely do not trust him.\n\nThank you all for your support.

{"prompt":"I've (18-f) been seeing this guy (19-m) for almost a yr now.  I thought we had something pretty special but over the last month or so I noticed him staring at my little sister alot (14) but when I confronted him he laughed it off and said I was just imagining it but a cpl days ago he spent the night and when I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom he wasn't there so I went to look for him and I heard noises coming from my sisters room so I poked my head in and saw  my bf on top of my sister.  I freaked and started screaming and that woke up my parents so my dad beat the shit out of him and almost killed him but my sister hasn't said a word since then and she screams if anyone tries to touch her and I can't help feeling like it's kinda my fault cause I'm the one who brought him into our house.  I can't sleep and the guilt is tearing me apart and I just don't know what to do\n\nEdit: pls don't send chat requests I won't accept them.\n\nEdit 2: some details I forgot to include - obviously he's now my ex bf.  I didn't call him that in the post cause he wasn't my ex when it happened and I didn't want ppl to get confused and be like why tf was your ex spending the night in the 1st place?  And yes we called 911 and are pressing charges, he's already technically under arrest but they can't take him to jail yet cause my dad messed him up and he's in the hospital.  My dad prolly would of killed him but my mom stopped him so he wouldn't be arrested too.  And my sister is already in therapy abt it but she's still not doing very good and I think part of it is cause she keeps having to police and prosecutors and stuff and they keep making her tell them every messed up detail of what he did to her.  And my dad hasn't been arrested for beating him up but their talking to a lawyer just in case.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This guy is the absolute scum of the earth, you did absolutely nothing wrong. None of this is your fault, it's 100% his wrong doing and he deserves every bad thing that happens now until the day he keels over and dies. Take a step back give your sister some space and time to process and do the same for you. Think about this clearly and write down what you remember if you haven't called the police yet, But most importantly this isn't your fault, he took advantage because he is a sorry excuse for a man. What happened you can't change but the way you react and move forward is going to mean more to your sister than you can imagine, make her feel supported and make sure she knows you care. This isn't going to be easy but nothing ever is, your sister needs to understand that this isn't her fault either and you guys as a family need to process this trauma together. I wish you guys nothing but the best and i sincerely hope your family can get through this together. You got this! END"}

{"prompt":"I've lived a very impoverished life. I was abused as a kid, bullied, and it's had an awful effect on my mental health. In my late teens (17-19) I dropped out of high school to raise my baby brother from 1 month to 18 months, I took in my two younger sisters aged 15 and 16, and I was tough because that's what I had to be. I worked and provided for my siblings. I tried my best to be flexible, understanding, and 2 parents to my siblings since that what I felt they deserved. With the last one off to college and my brother being taken back by his mother. I have been alone. With nobody to live for the shadow has grown immensely and taken over me. \n\nI went through depression like I have never experienced, gained weight, became suicidal, and lost my drive. I find it hard to live for myself because I don't feel I'm worth it. I blame myself for the abuse and have always hated myself because of it. My self confidence, worth, and image are awful and toxic. However I'm an optimist, out going, supportive, and outwardly positive person. I try and not let other people know I'm hurting. \n\nI have been unemployed since March due to covid. The past couple weeks the well was starting to look empty, so I began job hunting. Applying for everything and every job I got offered a position into a corporate manager training program. Don't ask me how. I've only ever worked as a cook or server in restaurants. My car broke down and junked months ago. So I was looking at working within biking distance at a local restaurant when I was offered the position. \n\nNow I'm looking at working downtown and I live an hours walk to the nearest bus station and an hour and a half away by bus. I was thinking about renting a car weekly, but I'm not sure. I need to do some math and find out what's the most efficient, what's the most realistic solution, and see where I can find a middle ground. I will make it work. This opportunity is phenomenal and I won't let it slip away. I don't want to fall into any pitfalls though. I don't know how to work in a professional office, I don't own any \"business professional\" clothes, and I don't want to look stupid or undeserving. Also any financial advice would be hugely accepted. \n\nMy parents have failed me immensely and I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff. I.e. be an adult \n\nP.s. through their failures I have grown what they could not teach. I'm thankful I was able to be there for my siblings and hold no ill feelings. They didn't grow up and so it is what it is. \n\nTl;dr my first professional office job and I don't know what to wear, say, or act. I also am asking for advice on how I should handle my finances. I'm broke always been broke, and I'm tired of that. Thanks in advance for anyone for reading\n\n\n**Update\nUpdate* I started my job. The bus isn't bad there, but im almost wrapped up with training. So I'll have to start having to secure regular transportation. Work is so new and weird. Everyone's so well dressed, but im getting by. I definitely feel out of place they all have sports coats I think their called. On the bright side the two hours there and back on the bus are great for studying, memorizing, and practicing. \n\nI've met with my bosses mentor and he seems like a great guy. I was told to ask him some questions, but I couldn't really think of any.\nI ended up getting help from the assistant manager to ask personal questions or questions I genuinely need help with. I explained that I've always lived my life for others, so now that im on my own I find it difficult to get motivated, make goals, or take control. He gave great advice. It was obviously genuine and I think I might've caught him off guard. It was nice getting advice. Honestly it felt like what I imagine having parents in the picture would be like. We talked other topics and I think it went well.\n\n Also I love my boss. He's a great guy who leads well, has good intentions, and trusts his gut. I think it's a terrific fit and these are good people. I feel safe, but this is just week one. Thanks again everyone for well wishes. \n\nP.s. I got a little worried for a second on day 3 because I started to be a little toxic. Thinking \"I don't deserve to be here, can I really do it, I should quit, quit now before you fail and let everyone down\". I pushed that aside and thought if im comfortable than im not growing and I need to push myself.

{"prompt":"I’m going to start with why this scenario even happened.\n\nAll my life, I was super feminine. Not in the way I dressed or acted, it was my body. I’m frail and small, and I probably have more estrogen in my body than testosterone. Whenever I transferred schools or had a new teacher, the teacher would always think a girl in my class do my work for me because even my handwriting was feminine. I was assigned a pen pal in foreign language class, and that pen pal was going to come to my school the next semester for foreign exchange. The teacher wanted us to write to that person to get to know them before they came. That pen pal thought I was a girl until they asked, four letters later because they were “attracted to me.” My unisex name doesn’t help. Because of my femininity, people made fun of me for it. Harassed me constantly. Even my friends joke and call me their “girlfriend.” And a few days before the assault happened, I found out some boys had a sexual fantasy about me, especially cause at the time my hair was a bit longer, just touching my chin, and was dyed blue and purple. They thought because I had a feminine hairstyle means I’m asking for it. Apparently, a lot of the boys in my high school have trap fantasies. \n\nAnyway, you get the jist. Here’s what happened.\n\nI was at a friend’s 16th birthday party. I started talking to this guy (M18) and we were just slightly tipsy. I’m bicurious, so I thought I might as well explore my sexuality since he’s already getting handsy. Plus, I trusted him. He thought my femininity didn’t matter, and people are just creepy. We eventually were in the guest room, and to put it bluntly, he was jerking me off. That part was consensual. Everything was going okay until I heard snickers in the room. The room was completely dark, and you couldn’t see a thing. I thought it was nothing, and it was just the guy I was with. Then it happened again. It sounded like a female, two females. I tell the guy to stop, there’s someone else in the room. He didn’t respond. I yelled at him to stop, and kneed him in the face. At this point, I knew there were four people in the room but I didn’t know who, because there were only four voices that seemed familiar but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. I tried to get my pants on and leave the room, but the guy pinned me down. I don’t remember exactly what he was whispering in my ear, but it was always along the lines of “stay still” or “were just gonna have some fun” and trust me, I was freaked out. I tried to do everything I could to get him off me, but he was stronger. He didn’t realize he was raping me, because he did everything he could to make me “feel good.” Surprise, just because you use lube doesn’t mean it won’t hurt them. And while I was crying and telling him to stop, those four people just watched. I think one even took a flash picture. After he was done, they left me there, door wide open and turned he lights on so if anyone walked in on me, they would think I’m some creep and kick me out. But, no one walked in. I was just laying there. After an hour or two, I got dressed and left the party. I walked home even though it hurt to take every step.\n\nWhen it was school again on Monday, I figured out who those four people were. My good friend told me that those four people who I thought were my friends\/acquaintances told a lot of people what happened and they pretended that I was a slut and wanted it, and I put on a “show” for all of them. No one believes I was raped besides that one good friend.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nTL;DR- Taking advantage of my femininity, a person raped me and four people watched and told everyone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tell the police.

{"prompt":"So I’m not too sure how to start this, and it’s probably going to be a mess of a post, but I’ll just start off with I’m 18 years old and I just got out of a 2 year very emotionally abusive relationship. 2 years of only playing with him and his friends on PlayStation. Never a day where I was on my own trying to make my own friends. I’m a very shy person so now that I’m on my own I’m trying to make my own friends. However, if I simply talk in game chat guys are mean to me. They call me trash or tell me to uninstall the game even when I’m above them on the leaderboard. I was the last one against the entire enemy team and I won the round for my team and they still voted to kick me. People tell me over and over again to “Go make them a sandwich because it is my job” now today I didn’t even have my mic unmuted and some guy still cursed me out. I get that its PlayStation and people are gonna be mean, but when I play with my brother they are always nice to him. I honestly started believing the things my ex said to me are true. I don’t know how to make friends without having these people make me feel bad about myself. Any advice helps. Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As someone with a very similar experience (except playing on PC), your best options are: \n\n1. not use a mic (and mute anyone who gives you shit) \n\n2.

These dudes are intentionally trying to make you feel like shit, NOTHING they are saying is true, don't let them get you down. Find a way to make it fun for yourself instead. Might not be a good suggestion until you work up more confidence and shake off the cobwebs of your abusive relationships.\n\n4. Play games where no one talks to each other in-game, like Destiny 2 (I've literally only ever been in ONE game where someone used their mic)\n\n5. Play single player games\n\n6.

I'm gone 11 hours a day *minimum* (because of the commute, and no, moving closer to work is not an option, unless I was over half my salary going towards housing), and I feel completely exhausted *all the time*.\n\nI basically don't leave my room anymore, because all I feel I have the energy for is either playing video games or going to sleep. It's a struggle just to force myself to go buy groceries or do \"grown-up\" shit.\n\nI don't know what's missing. Maybe it's my perspective -- I think most people would probably kill to be in my position. But it honestly feels like time is just ticking by. All I do on the weekends is sleep, play games, or *occasionally* watch TV (which is rare, because I have roommates and I just don't like watching TV in the living room when they're around).\n\nI don't want to do anything that's going to sabotage myself -- like quitting my job, just to wind up struggling to find minimum-wage work again, probably moving back in with my dad and his wife or something.\n\nAt the same time, though... I feel like my life is on a *very* specific track. And that track goes as follows: I continue working every day, I never meet anyone because I never go out and lack the time and energy to do so, and eventually I just die. I don't even think I'll make it to \"retirement\".\n\nI cannot fathom anyone doing this shit, working 40+ hours a week, and thinking \"This is good enough\". As far as I'm concerned, I don't have any sort of \"life\". As the risk of sounding pretentious, I genuinely feel like a *slave*, that I lack any freedom to \"do what I want\". I don't even know *what* I want, but I lack the freedom to even explore the life around me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yeah fuck that commute basically. You're not working an 8 hour day.

They're probably the people I'm closest to because I don't have a lot of friends, as sad as that sounds. \n\nWe usually hang out in my room, but for the past couple of months (from a little before lock down began - we're not in lock down anymore), they've been continuously coming into my room while I'm not there and making a giant mess, then leaving it for me to clean up once they've left. \n\nThey don't listen to me when I do tell them. They say they'll clean their mess up, or they won't have food or water in there, or they'll ask before coming into my room, but they still do it anyway. \n\nIt's really frustrating, and I try not to get angry at them besides letting them know I don't like the messes they make because I feel incredibly guilty. Yesterday was my breaking point. I left for work at 8:30am and came home at 5:00pm. I worked on university assignments until 8:30pm and was ready to chill and play Animal Crossing. \n\nWhen I walked into my room, it was absolute chaos. Water had spilled on chargers and electronics, they smeared chocolate and juice all over my bed sheets, they flipped my mattress over, the windows were open, they managed to delete my Animal Crossing save file, and they managed to pull the saddle off of my ukulele that I've had since I was 15 and completely broke it. \n\nI got so mad, and I told them to get out and go to their room. I only got angrier when they dicked around for 5 minutes before leaving. I just stared at the mess and cried for like 20 minutes. And I decided I would be firm and not allow them in my room again. My dad (who's usually a drunken asshole) was the only one to feel sorry for me and actually fixed my uke by the time I'd woken up the next day. \n\nWhen I explained what had happened to my mum, she just said \"that's your decision to make\". No sympathy or discipline for them. She said she \"wasn't taking sides\", but I feel like by acting as a so called mediator and not acknowledging their bad behaviour, she's acting like I'm the bad guy. I feel like my space isn't being respected, especially by my two youngest sisters who are practically a part of me. \n\nBut at the same time, I feel like I'm overreacting because other people that I've spoken to (friends and my siblings closer to my age) don't really care either.

Are you in the US? In high school? You could speak with the school guidance counselor. Make sure he\/she knows you no longer feel threatened but you want to tell your mom. The only issue here is that he\/she may be legally bound to report it.

{"prompt":"When I was 14, I remember being at my friend's (11) house with his younger brother (9). We were all close friends back then despite the age gaps since not many children were in our neighborhood. For some reason, I had this godforsaken idea to take my penis out and wank in front of them. I don't exactly recall if we were laughing about it or not. I thought it was a normal thing to do because during the time when I was in camp, on 6th grade, I heard that the other boys were showing off each other their penises and stuff. \n\nI recently just recalled this memory because of another one that happened way way back my childhood. I was laying in bed when suddenly, I realized I was basically abused by a man when I was 7. I was playing with another kid back then on the arcade when the man started talking to us and last thing I know, he started touching me and ended up wanking my penis. I didn't knew back then that what he did was not okay but I was confused about the sensation it caused and yet, I chose not to tell my parents when I got home. I am also introverted and quiet , which contributed to me being silent about it.\n\nNow, I think I'm a horrible human being and that I don't deserve anything good that ever happened to me. I'm feeling really low right now because of this realization. I'm 20 and maybe the fact that I was gay meant that what I did back then was absolutely something sexual and not just playful experimentation. I don't know what to do. I want to apologize to them but they've moved years ago and we haven't talked since but we're still connected through our social media. I'm scared to talk about this to my current friends because I'm afraid of how they will react. I even doubt if I should post it here because I basically caused this, myself. I would very much appreciate any advice on what to do because I'm afraid of what it would lead into if I continue having this suffocating feeling on my chest.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I have several words for you.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am so sorry that you were abused.\n\nSecond, you didn't know what you were doing. You just said that you didn't know. Usually, people or kids who have been abused are more prone to abuse others in the future (than people who never were). But, one reason for children or teens doing that, might be that they don't know if it is right or wrong since it happened to them already as well. \n\nI am no professional so I don't know enough to understand and explain this. But here comes the second thing that I have for you: [Rainn.org](https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/), a free anonymous chatline where you can talk to trained volunteers about what happened to you and help you make sense of it. They aren't your therapist but they might help you grasp a bit, find some resources to read so you can understand better what happened, and they also can help you find the next steps that you might want to take, following your pace and wishes, including helping find a therapist. I highly recommend them.\n\nThe third thing I have for you is to consider, if you want and feel it's right for you, to find a therapist that you can talk with to help make sense of things and make peace with everything that happened, from the man who hurt you to when you inadvertedly might have hurt the other kids.\n\nThe fourth, and this will be highly personal, but whenever\/if you're ready, and if you feel it makes sense to you, is to find those kids that you talked about in your story, and talk with them. Some reasons why I think that might be a good idea:\n\n- They might not remember it, and they might have had a trauma that affects them in their life and relationships, and they don't know because they repressed the memory;\n\n- They might remember it, but still struggle to make sense of it (and half-repress it just as an 'odd memory'; or think if they might have imagined it. This might help them understand things better as well.\n\n- They might remember it, and still feel hurt about it, and even though you contacting them might cause them to relive the hurt again, that might also help them in their journey. I would be terrified if my abuser apologized to me, but he was also a man and knew very well what he was doing. A truthful apology and willingness to listen and understand their story if they want to talk (or share yours if you want) might help all hearts heal even if it hurts first. At the same time, when I was little, younger kids showed off their genitals to me, and while I was shocked at the time by the behaviour, it would be awkward for me to hear from them apologizing to me, but they were also younger than 5, so I'd rather just not talk about it anymore lol, I understand they didn't know what they were doing.\n\nThis is very a very personal journey, though. The feeling on your chest unbearable, please find someone you can talk to, whether it is a real life friend, an internet friend, or a new internet friend at r\/momforaminute, r\/dadforaminute, r\/internetparents. Or just a therapist if you can find one. \n\nLast things I want to say, you are NOT a horrible human being. First of all, you just remembered it and felt guilty. That is 100% not horrible human being behaviour. Second, you were a kid, and you were having sequels from an abuse you didn't even remember because you repressed it and you had absolutely no support about.\n\nListen, my friend. You deserve to find help. And you didn't cause this yourself. A man caused it to you first. \n\nAnd you don't have to tell anyone about it. The people you tell about you just have to tell when you feel safe and comfortable. Unfortunately, these days it's still a hit or miss to find someone irl who will believe a boy's story of sexual abuse, depending on your social circles and all. My suggestion is to make both stories a separate thing . Find first someone who will understand that you have been abused. Then give it time. Don't make it \"I have been abused but then it's my fault because I then did this to two kids\". Breathe, calm down, even if it's burning in your chest, save it for next time. I have blurted to people things that I wasn't ready to blurt out because I felt guilt to tell more details than I was ready to tell. And you also want to know that you can count on those people to support you and not judge you before you tell the other story.\n\nAlso, being gay doesn't mean being an abuser, that's most probably just unrelated. \n\nI wish you the absolute best - again I totally recommend RAINN, they are absolutely amazing. This is all your personal journey as well so listen to your feelings, take care of yourself. \n\nLast advice is that the next days and months might feel shit for you and like a rollercoaster of emotions, but if you can find some support and take care of yourself, you will eventually find some peace in your life again.\n\nI truly wish you the best, you deserve help and love and safety and to take back control of your life at your own wishes and pace, this is your journey. Don't blame yourself for anything, for not having spoken up, for not opening up to people, please be gentle to yourself. END"}

I heard there may already be a rumor about me being in the hospital and don't know if someone heard something or saw me there or what it's all about.   \n\nHow do I deal with this shame?   I feel like such a terrible person right now because of what I did.  I practically begged my friend to have sex with me and when he did I got pregnant and had to tell him and then he was all nice and supportive but I haven't seen him since Wednesday morning when he stopped on his way to school to give me some flowers and I think he texted me yesterday but i wasn't up to talking to anyone because I'm sick and crampy and disgusting.  \n\nHow can I go to school tomorrow?  Should I text my friend back or wait for him to get back to me?  What should I tell my friends and teachers?   I think they will know what happened just by looking at me.  I don't look the same.  I don't feel the same.  I don't think I am the same as I was.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/mu7x2h\/im\\_16\\_im\\_pregnant\\_i\\_need\\_advice\\_now\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/mu7x2h\/im_16_im_pregnant_i_need_advice_now\/)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [deleted] END"}

{"prompt":"(F)I am posting this incase something happens to me. This situation has been going on for four years now and it continues to worsen. As I post this, I am still underage but I can understand the severity of the situation. I can't reveal to much information about what's going on because my abuser is currently in jail and still has an open case about what's going on but I need to put this somewhere incase something happens to me. \nThis person groomed me when I was 13, he was going on 17. From the second week of talking to him I knew there was something off about him. He had told me how he had killed people and was being paid for it. He was weirdly obsessed with me and being overly sexual at times and possesive. I even pretended to date my girl best friend so he would leave me alone. When this happened, he pretended to slit his wrist and sent pictures to me and my friend. Her mom called the police and he got in trouble but it was really just a slap on the wrist. This happened the week right before new years in 2017. He left me alone for about two months.\nHe started contacting me again in February and started telling me about how he was selling drugs and doing other extremely suspicious stuff.\nHe began to threaten me and say he was going I shoot up my house. It got to the point where someone even came to my house and was walking around outside one night when my dad wasn't home. My parents had no idea this was going on but I ended up talking to the school officer and he talked to the kid and told him to leave me alone and he did. He had threatened to shoot up my house and send people after me because he was angry we couldn't be in a relationship. This happened in March of 2018.\nSo excatly a year pasts and I walked into the room we met for practice and my friend who knew what had happened told me that he had gotten arrested for shooting up someone's house. It ce out later on that he held his then girlfriend at knife point and then shot up her friends house. \nSo I can't talk about what happened after that but basically he contacted me and abunch of really bad stuff started happening. I can't go too much into detail but my parents took me to the police station and one of the officers said that with all the evidence and surrounding factors he was trying to sex traffict me with blackmail and extortion.\nSince this has happened, he was released on bail and continued to make over ten fake accounts and continusly harass me saying extremely vulgar and disturbing things. My parents reported it only so many times before they stopped because the police were doing absolutely nothing about what was going now.\nNow with that being said, I have been being harrassed by someone which I know he must be involved with. I think it's his girlfriend and one of his friends but I am not certain. He was arrested in October and the harrassment still continues.\nAbout three weeks ago, A man showed up at my house one day when my parents were not home and I did not recognize him so I did not answer the door. Both my parents were an hour away so I called my mom and asked her if it was someone my dad was expecting and she said he was not expecting anyone. We were on the phone for a minute and she told me to see if they were still there and the guy was walking to his car. So I told her that and she said stay on the phone and I did and all of a sudden he was walking back to the house with what I assume was a women. The guy was probably 5'9-5'10 and looked like he was in his late 20s. There was a tall women with blonde hair but I did not see her face. I told my mom this and she said don't go by the door and they knocked. They went back to their car and came back knocked about three times over the span of 20 minutes. While this was happening my mom hung up and called the police. \nWhile I was waiting I saw a white mini van drive past my house twice pretty slow. The officer asked if I saw what the car look like and I said not because it was behind the camper in our drive way. I told him I saw a white mini van drive by twice and he said there was a white car pulled off to the side of the road across from my house. He left and he said if anything happy to call and he'll come back. \nSo I had taken a picture of them in my driveway and my dad said he did not recognize them and no one else in the house did. My dad asked a few of his friends if it was them or if they knew who it was and even posted it on face book and no one knows who it was.\nalso when we came back from the funeral last weekend our front door was wide open my dad had to go in to see if somebody was in the house because he was the last one out and had shut and locked the door. No one was in the house but things in our downstairs area were moved around. \nNothing has happened since but I am becoming more and more worried that soemthing is going to happen to me. The police do not seem concerned and this person is getting released with in the next 1-2 years. I could really use some advice about this situation because I really don't know what to do. Please do not report this or try to figure out who I am because if you try to help by contacting the police nothing will happen.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Go to the FBI. Now. They’ll handle this.

{"prompt":"We currently have nine cats. *Nine*. I cannot take it anymore. We burn through cat food, which has to be an expensive brand because of my roommate's cat and its bowel problems. The house and my clothes are constantly covered in hair. It always smells in here. My furniture is forever ruined. One of the little buggers always has diarrhea and goes outside of the box. Another one likes to spray on everything even though he is fixed.\n\nI am sick of it. When we moved into this house, a little less than two years ago, we had three cats, one of which came along with the property. That's a lot, but manageable. We then asked a friend to move in and he brought along his two cats. Five. Okay, that's a little too many, but I wasn't being driven insane, yet. \n\nThen we bring in two stray kittens that are now adults. Then a cat shows up and my girlfriend mistakenly brings it in, but instead of putting it back out immediately she puts up a fight about how the cat belongs to *someone* and we need to shelter it from the incoming severe weather. I went to sleep pissed, but I actually expected her and my roommate to make an effort of finding that cat's home, instead of going to two houses and calling it quits. Then, another cat. \n\nHere I am. Overwhelmed by cats. I am tired of it. I'm ready to find five cats good homes. I do not want to take them to a shelter, but I am not opposed to it. We managed to give away an entire litter within a month, but that was cute little kittens. This will be harder, and I need some good advice so that I can finally find peace.

If they're draining your income and emotional health, you need to straight-up tell her that you'll work with her to find them homes, but most of them have to go. Don't assume she'll do it on her own. Sit down with her and your roommate and tell them you're serious about this, and that worst-case scenario, you will have to send some to the shelter. Make sure they understand that if they don't put effort into getting homes for these animals, they will be sent to a shelter and could very well die there.\n\nIt's totally not ok for you to have to live with that, especially when you're this uncomfortable.

Just dumb stuff and never did I ever cross a line.\n\nRecently she sat me down in a serious tone and started to talking in a shaky tone and saying she cheated on me with a random guy. I was so shocked and in disblief. She kept the lie going for about 30 min in wich I kept asking her if she was lying because I genuinely didn't believe it. I also started to lose all hope and love in those 30 min as my heart slowly started to snap in half. It genuinely felt like someone ripped my heart out and punched back in until it broke. I genuinely almost had an panic attack. I grabbed my shit and just started walking to the door as I didn't know what to do, because I was reaching an emotional limit I didn't want to reach. She stopped by the door twlling me it's a prank and showing me cameras and she was making a joke video for fucking tiktok\/yt. She doesn't even upload for tiktok or yt, but was always telling she wanted to.\n\nI left and told her to fuck off. Am I being too emotional?

{"prompt":"Life got really dark really quickly.\n\nMy mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (stage 0 thank goodness but still scary).\n\nI keep reading articles about how Covid will “never end,” which is awful because I was supposed to go to college.\n\nSpeaking of college, I used to be very excited for it. I hated elementary and high school, I never had any friends, but I also feel my childhood leaving me. I turn 18 in a couple of days and I’m having a “midlife crisis” because I just feel like im getting so old so quickly. And I miss being in elementary school and I wish how innocent I was. I miss not having to care about what I look like, what I believe, what I say. I wish I wasn’t as self conscious. Life was just so much simpler.\n\nIdk what brought this on. It’s snowing where I am, so I like to go for walks in the snow. I walked by my old elementary school and it made me cry, thinking about how easy and nice life was back then. How life felt like it had a golden tint, or glow. And now life just seems so barren, cold, and colorless. I also walked by my park, where the one and only weeping willow tree came down. Idk, something about the decay just really hurts. I could cry now. I think I might. I’m just looking for some advice I guess.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Oh honey.

Eventually everyone will get it, but we'll also have more effective treatments and vaccines to combat it, so this isn't going to last. \n\nShops will be closed but new ones will open In their places.

{"prompt":"Male, 24, United States\n\nAround a week ago, a landscaping company had cut my internet cable by accident while they were working on the lawn around my complex.  Thus, our line was disconnected and we did not have service.  I went to Suddenlink to get it fixed and they came out around a week later and replaced the cord.  Later that night, my internet went out again and we were wondering why.  I went outside and a neighbor whom I don't really communicate with said that whoever replaced my cable had also disconnected his line.  Thus, he rectified the problem by disconnecting my line an plugging his back in.  \n\nIs this a situation that I should get the police involved?  Given that he did not work for the company and had no right to do what he did, he was definitely in the wrong.  However, I am not entirely sure if this is illegal.  Would the police even be able to help in this situation?\n\n\nEdit (Update 1):  Bear with me because this might take a while.  After the confrontation with my neighbor, my girlfriend and I went to bed with plans to go to Suddenlink so that they might fix our internet again.  When I went to my vehicle in the morning, I found that someone had broken into both my car and my gf's car.  There didn't seem to be any signs of forced entry (we probably left our vehicles unlocked like some dummies) and nothing was stolen.  Obviously someone had gone through our stuff but did not take anything.  They did remove my backpack with library books and threw it into my front yard (if one can even call the grass in front of my apartment a \"yard\").  They didn't take anything out of the bag but did leave all of the zippers open.  We filed a police report and mentioned the altercation we had with our neighbors.  My gf thinks that the guy had broken into our car but I know that there are crazy people at our complex.  Plus, I wanted to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt.  However, I thought I should mention it to the police regardless. \n\nFlashforward to today.  The Suddenlink guy came out to fix our internet.  This time it was some other person who shall go nameless.  They fixed our internet and the box itself so that it locked properly.  After he left, our internet was back on.  About fifteen minutes later, it cut off completely.  Familiar with this problem, we went out to see if our neighbor had disconnected our line.  Sure enough, he had.  This time, he LITTERALLY cut our line.  We confronted him and he was obviously angry and even admitted to cutting the line.  He was pretty unkind to us and we decided to file a police report and call the company back (luckily the guy who worked on our box gave us his number).  The company has also filed a report with the police. The cable guy came back and fixed the problem, this time for good.  I have no idea if our neighbor's internet is out now and frankly do not care.  We have reported him to the police and our landlords as this is technically destruction of property, even if it is not our property.  If anything changes after this, I will post additional updates.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Same exact thing happened to me, neighbors got internet after stuffing us for 3 months (we were sharing, they paid 20\/mo was the deal) so after 3 months I finally changed the password after asking a few times.

Felt double screwed over that’s for sure.\n\nThe person who installed it was to blame, I didn’t go disconnect there’s but waiting the two days for them to come do it correctly. It’s quite annoying, I know. Your neighbor takes the cake, they should have called the cable company. \n\nCall your cable company and have them send a tech out ASAP because whoever installed yours took the lazy way out. They’re supposed to and able to see what units they are providing service to, this guy simply didn’t do his job.

{"prompt":"I just graduated high school, and my mother surprised me with a quilt that she had somebody make that was a collage of a bunch of my t shirts from different events. The idea is thoughtful and lovely, but the issue lies in the fact that she didn't ask before she raised my drawers. There are three shirts in there that I would have never in a million years wanted cut up and sewn into the blanket. Two are from a summer camp I attended for 8 years (I wore the shirts all the time and they had great memories attached to them) and one is from my freshman year jazz vocal festival. That was the first year I won an individual award for my solos and I was so so proud. It was the first time I felt like everybody saw me and recognized that I was good. I loved that shirt and the memories it carried. And now it's cut up and I can never take it to college or wear it again. Every time I look at the blanket I start crying. It's been a week and I still just tear up on sight. I know it's really dumb that I'm getting so upset but it's like the memories and the pride were destroyed too. She tried so hard to be thoughtful and I played off the initial tears as being overwhelmed by graduating and stuff (it was at my party) but I can't get it out of my head. I love her and I love that she put the effort into giving me something so personal but I'm so incredibly upset at the same time. I don't know if I should talk to her about it because there's nothing they can be done. I can't buy the shirts online because they were for the specific events. I'm just kind of stuck deciding between internalizing it and sucking it up or talking to her. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: Woahhhh this blew up way more than I was expecting. I really appreciate all of your input and I'm happy so many people took the time to offer advice! For people who say my mother might get angry if I said something: my reasoning for wanting to keep it from her is because I know how absolutely devastated she would be if she knew she had made me upset with this. She would probably feel arguably worse than I do about it and I don't want her to be so upset. To everybody saying it's probably better as a quilt and I'll learn to like it better that the shirts, you're probably right, I'll get there someday. Upon further introspection, I think some of my sadness stems from the fact that my senior year was half cancelled and I didn't get to go to the state festivals this year. So it was a combination of losing (altering, I guess) some of the treasured memories from high school and not being able to finish making them? I guess it all kind of hit me at once and made me more upset than I would have otherwise been. I don't think I am going to say anything because I know it wouldn't really make me feel any better and it would make her feel AWFUL. Maybe in the future I'll bring it up casually, but I think I'll be okay. Thank you to everybody who commented!

{"prompt":"So the last 24 hours has been rough. My mother just packed her things and left. The only reason I was aware is cause during my lunch break (I work from home at the moment) I caught her packing. I thought her and my dad were going on a trip so I asked where are they going. She just lied and told me she’s not going anywhere. I clearly could see the suitcase she was packing and told her I can see what she is doing. At that point she closed the door and I was in shock so I went back to my workplace trying to process what I should do next. She eventually told my sister she was leaving to my aunt’s home which is located in another state for the next 2 weeks. Honestly I wanted to tell her to stay but thought she might need some space because of an argument she had with my dad 3 weeks ago. So I didn’t even ask any questions and she left in an Uber. My siblings and I were all shocked since this came out of nowhere and she typically lets us know if she plans on seeing her sister. And we didn’t even know how we should break the news to dad.\n\nCome Saturday morning we find out she did not go with my aunt. We were frantic. We reached out to all her friends and her side of the family only to find out no one knew where she went. She must have turned off her phone because it would go straight to voice mail. It was one of the worst experiences of my life, not knowing if my mother was safe or where she was in the world. \n\nEventually a friend of hers was able to get in contact with her and let us know she was in a hotel and safe but that was all the information my mother was giving her. We still don’t know where she is or even if she even plans on coming back. I feel awful because my gut told me to ask her to stay and I’m hurt because I feel like she abandoned her family. I’m 25F, with 4 siblings, 21F, 19F, 12F and 10M. So far the 2 younger ones believe she’s with my aunt. My\nMother may not come back. I don’t know how to explain the situation to them. Yes they’re kids but the are not oblivious. They are already wondering why our mother hasn’t called. It’s not something I’ve discussed with my father cause he shut down once he heard she was okay BUT didn’t want to talk to us. I need some advice on what I can do to help my family.\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for your kind words and just giving me a direction to head in. Right now we are keeping the kids distracted and luckily my Aunt was able to get in communication with my mother. So far she isn’t talking to us but from what my aunt has updated me on, it seems like my mom will be headed over there. It’s reassuring to know that my mom will be with someone she knows. Again thank you everyone for your advice!\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I just want to update this just in case someone passes through a similar situation. It’s been a little over 2 weeks since my mom has left and I was able to visit her at my aunts house for 2 days since she’s a few states away. We were able to talk and it turns out she was hiding a lot of stuff my dad had put her through. She finally reached her breaking point and did have a mental breakdown. She let me know her journey and honestly it’s heartbreaking. Turns out she’s been taking a lot of medication due to depression, anxiety and PTSD.\n\nShe’s done with her marriage. Which I understand. My dad isn’t a easy person to live with. My mom has been a stay at home mom for a long time so right now she wants to start working so she can try to get custody of the two little ones. Right now she’s still broken and struggling to stand up on her own two feet since she is trying to get off the medication.\n\nI have a long journey ahead of me and so does my family. I can only hope that one day I’ll be able to be with my mom again cause she means the world to me and it’s been so hard living without her. As of right now my dad isn’t aware she wants a divorce. She let me know that is a conversation they need to have and my mom just needs to figure out what to say. \n\nThank you everyone for your kind words.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wow this is so heartbreaking.  Sending big hugs your way.  This shouldn’t be your responsibility, and I’m so sorry that you are bearing the weight of this.  \n\nDo you know what they argued about that created such an extreme reaction?  Has she “checked out” physically or emotionally from your family before?  I’m wondering if she is going through something so shocking or heavy that she couldn’t process it while also being in her normal routine life. Knowing that, and how her emotional state has been lately and historically, might give you a better idea of her mental state and her likelihood of returning.\n\nFirst thing I’d do is talk to your dad.  I’m sure he’s in shock and not handling it well, but it is his job to pull himself out of that and be there for his younger kids.  He doesn’t get to check out and pretend nothing is happening, and he should be trying to make this situation have as little of a damaging impact on them as possible.  And if their fight led to this, he might have an idea if this is something more permanent or if she is just processing things.  His knowledge might help guide how this should be presented to your younger siblings.\n\nSecond, I’d send your mom a message.  I’d send it to any info you have, since I’m guessing she still checks something that she has used in the past.  It’s probably best not to guilt her, since she clearly has some shit going on and that might make her more likely to hide, but maybe just let her know how much you all love her and want to help her through whatever she is going through.\n\nAs for your siblings, that’s where it gets harder.  Try to keep their routines intact.  Do things together as a family that are fun and bonding.  If they have to find out the truth, and if they have to face that she might not come back at all, they are going to have to deal with some very serious abandonment issues.  If your mom doesn’t come back, they should be in therapy, a school counselor should check in with them often, and they may need more academic support.\n\nOnce you are out of the immediate crisis mode, you should talk with a counselor as well.  I know your first priority is what you can do for your family, but please also make sure you take care of yourself.\n\nAgain, I’m so sorry that this is on you, and I’m sending you strength and hope.

She is the coolest person i know and i really feel like she was a person you meet once in a lifetime. The problem is, i have a really bad habit of running late and forgetting things, so i always ran late when we had to meet up and hang out. It wasn't a big deal when i ran late for like 10 minutes or something, but i used to be late for 30 minutes or more. But she forgave me. Every.  Fucking. Time. I don't know why i keep doing it, but i simply can't seem to manage my time. I procrastinate, i run late, i don't pay attention, i'm a hot mess if you will. Yet, apart from all that, she still forgave me. She was the best friend ever. \n\nNow, here's when i fucked up the most. Started college, met a girl (19F), let's call her Becky.

This time it was different. She was understandably mad. We didn't talk, and halfway, she started to simply say: \"You know, I think you just don't care. I had a shit day, and was looking forward to meeting with you, but yet you had me wait for 50 fucking minutes\". I felt devastated. I really care about her, you know but yet, i still forgot, i still was an asshole. I thought with my dick instead of my brain.\n\nI feel like an asshole, like i'm the worst friend ever, and maybe i am.

{"prompt":"So about 2 months ago I was randomly drug tested at work and tested positive for weed. I was a daily smoker usually only to help me sleep and pain relief. Smoking for me was never about partying or abusing it. I only smoke by myself. I've worked for this company for over 2 years now and in good standings. Never once late for a shift, always productive and done my job correctly. There was no reason to believe that me smoking weed during my free time affected my work performance in any way.\n\nAfter the results of the random drug test comes back, hr informs me that I failed. I had 2 choices ; I could either be terminated or suspended until I can test clean and go through treatment. I decided for the suspension because I enjoy my job and I'm good at it. I knew it would take a while to get clean, but I was willing to go through it. It took about 40 days to start testing negative, so after waiting for the test to come back I lost about 6 weeks worth of pay. On top of that, I am currently attending these treatment classes every Tuesday for 3 hours to talk about our addictions. Most people in the class were addicted to hard drugs and\/or alcohol. So I jump through all the hoops and get back to work as soon as the test come back negative. I have busted my ass trying to catch up with everything I've missed, and I have accomplished this within the week.\n\nThe very next week, HR sends a company wide email saying that they are no longer testing for weed with their pre employment or random drug testing. I can't imagine this is a coincidence that as soon as I get back they changed their policy. They know that I'm a good worker and they suspended me for no reason for such a long period of time. Do I have any grounds to demand some sort of back pay for the time I missed? Hr also told me that since I failed before the policy change that I have to continue treatment. I feel that this is completely unfair due to the timing of this policy change\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The timing sure is frustrating. But not much you can do. \n\nThe only thing you might have a case for is discontinuing the treatment. But HR has to follow their rules. \n\nAt least, once you’re done, you don’t have to worry about testing positive on randoms anymore. \n\nI would advise against lawyering up, unless you want to find a new job. If you bring a lawyer into the mix, your employer will most likely find a way to let you go once its all completed. No employer wants to keep an employee that has tried to sue them.\n\nAlso something to consider if you ever want to sue for wrongful termination. It will make it harder for you to find a future job. Someone who is quick to lawyer up is a risky hire. Not saying its right, just saying how it is. END"}

I seriously feel bored all the time. I’m surrounded by loving and supporting friends and family but honestly? I feel nothing for them no matter how hard I try. Recently my mother asked me if I loved her and I couldn’t respond. She’s the most amazing and caring woman in my life and if I could love one person it would be her but honestly I just feel constantly empty and bored. I don’t want the human experience of being alive anymore, it’s so boring and I see no purpose in it. I’m not sad, and I won’t actively kill myself, but I have some worsening health conditions that are getting really bad but I just can’t seem to care. I think all humans, including myself are so disgusting... living insignificant lives with 9-5 jobs then dying. I don’t know why I’m alive, i feel nothing, I’d rather be sad than feel so bored all the time. Nothing brings me excitement or happiness, and this isn’t a recent thing. It’s always been like this, even as a child I’ve pondered why I’m here on this earth. I see being alive as a chore honestly. I don’t want the human existence anymore, everything from having to drink water, go to school, put clothes on is so so tiring. I’m not sure if anyone will understand my thought process but I am not sad. I know life is meaningless and I’m bored of it, I’ve lived enough to know that I don’t like it. I am comforted by the idea of dying and simply not existing anymore. I feel like I’m more than just my body, and I want to be freed from the human existence. I like nothing in this life, next year I’m going to university to study a psychology degree. I don’t like psychology, but it’s the only decently paying career I can get into. I’m going to live a boring life, get married to someone I feel nothing for and have a boring job then die, and for what. I truly have no passions and feel nothing and know there is no point to live.

I don’t see my mother much because she works two jobs in a city one and a half hours from my home, and my dad stays home with me to help put me in my wheelchair, use the bathroom, and other things I need. I really only have one good friend and I can’t see him or anyone because of Covid. You see I have a progressive disease that makes my muscles weaker as I get older, and today just by playing a simple video game I realized how bad I am because I can’t move like others. Video games are my favorite hobbies and to be honest that’s what I mostly look forward to doing. But it hurts me to say I may never be able to play a single game one day. I just need some advice\/encouragement. Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My brother and I were homeschooled for a few years by an absent mother—we hated it. He has cerebral palsy too, and though we’re in our early 20s now he’s starting to feel his body deteriorating a lot quicker too (partially due to a couple of car accidents he was in). He‘s dealing with a lot of the same stuff you are, and it’s tough to have to think about stuff that serious that far into the future, especially when you’re 14. We both love video games too, and even now that we live a few hours away, we can still enjoy those activities together.\n\nOf course, you have an additional challenge in your childhood that he never had to deal with: COVID. It’s a tough time for a lot of people for a lot of reasons. This makes it really hard to socialize on top of the SMA and homeschooling complications. Eventually me and my brother got tired of homeschooling and we pushed really hard to go back to public school, and our mom caved. That may or may not be something you want to do. It was certainly a weird transition for us when we got back to that school.\n\nAt least you have the one friend though. One good friend can make a world of difference. I had one friend when I was homeschooled and we really got close and spent almost every day together. This past year we both got to go to each other’s wedding and we’re still good friends a decade later. I know COVID is limiting how much you can spend time with him physically, but at least video games can help keep you virtually connected for now, and hopefully when this vaccine starts circulating more things can be more normal and you can see him more.\n\nHow severe is your SMA by the way? Is it really affecting your ability to play? If nothing else, my brother and I have started playing Dungeons and Dragons recently, which doesn’t require pressing and buttons or anything physical really. I never thought I would play D&D in high school, but I use it to hang out with my small group of friends who live several hours away, so it’s been a great activity during the pandemic. END"}

His nephew (17m) was looking with me when i checked under the bed. That's when it happened, there was a yellow ziplock bag that looked to be full of some unknown liquid, i poke it and then ask his nephew if he knows what it is. He picks it up and that's the moment we realised this was most likely piss. His nephew is absolutely disgusted and so was i tbh, but i still wanted to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt. Because the idea of me sleeping above a bag of piss wasn't something i found exciting.    \nWhen i enter the car with no phone and a confused and grossed out expression my boyfriend ofc asks me what was on my mind. I tell him i found his little contraption and asked him if there was piss in the bag. He gets defensive immidatly.

It only really happens when I’m upset, nervous etc. tho. (Like when I answer a question in class or am having a fight)\n\nI’m really thinking about going mute after what happened Last week. It was the worst I’ve ever gotten to. A teacher asked me something and I got kinda nervous. I tried to say one word, started stuttering, got embarrassed, especially when people started laughing at me (like they often do). My hand started cramping, I got a blurry vision and started crying. I couldn’t stop my stuttering nor my hand cramping etc. so it was really stressing me out. \n\nI’m always really embarrassed about the stuttering and I really want it to stop. I had a friend who got Tourette- like symptoms after being very stressed and depressed, so maybe something like that is happening to me too?

{"prompt":"tl;dr: rescued a 6wk old kitten and decided to keep her with us and our 6 year old cat, they get along, she eats drinks poops and pees just fine, she has mites or fleas or something and she’s going to the vet today to get an assessment and a work up. I’ve never had such a young cat although I’ve had many before - what do I need to know or do differently for her?\n\nLong story: I was going to my car after being in a store for a few minutes and heard a squeaking sound and there was a kitten under my tire. at first I thought I’d crushed her but under further inspection she was just huddled against it because it was warm.\n\nI immediately panicked, got my blanket out of the car and wrapped her in it and drove home. I’ve never had a cat this small but I have had several cats and kittens, and we have a 6 year old cat now so I figured it would be good to dry her off, brush her, warm her up and then we immediately took her to the vet. They were about to close but they were able to sex her, estimate her age, weigh her, and schedule an appointment for later today so we can get her assessed and give her shots.\n\nShe’s 6 weeks old, weighs 1.4 pounds, is female and isn’t observably sick...just terrified and cold. We went and got some kitten supplies and went home. Upon further inspection when we got home she has mites or fleas so we gave her a bath with flea shampoo, then quarantined her with some wet food, water, the carrying case we took her to the vet in, and her own litter box. \n\nDespite a moderate amount of fleas and being stuck in the freezing rain for who knows how long, she has a good amount of energy and played with us some. We were able to clip her nails, she used the litter box for both functions, and otherwise just coddled her all night.  \n\nBetween her and the big kitty there was some hissing at first but by the morning time they were amiable. He groomed her and pet her a little bit. He’s always done well with other cats and animals, so I’m not concerned. She doesn’t appear to be fazed by him, just a small and very...not-intimidating hiss so he’ll respect her space.\n\nI’ve never had a cat this young or had 2 cats with such an age gap. I’m anxious to go to the vet and learn more from a professional what our next steps are but what can we do in the mean time? What do you suggest?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Be a bit more fragile and careful with the kitten as it's young is pretty much the only advice I can give, but I'm sure you'll be careful anyways.

I saw how bad he felt during all this. My father isn’t a bad parent or an aggressive father, normally he‘s so calm. That’s why I respect him.

Anyways, after that he came in my room and we had a little talk alone without my sister or my mother.\n\nHe came in and said „Holy shit, did I do this mess? My god...“.

And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.  \n>  \n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  \n>  \n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  \n>  \n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  \n>  \n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. END"}
{"prompt":"The doctor gave my wife the green light to go home from the hospital but after 2 weeks of my wife being in excruciating pain, we were to the point of believing that this pain was not normal post child birth pain. I had my wife lie down so I could take a look (I would have sooner, but my wife was in a lot of pain and we thought it was normal recovery pain). Low and behold, a sharp silver shiny object sticking out of my wife. I ran her to the ER (it was Sunday and the doctors office was closed) to get the needle taken out. The ER doc was bewildered that this happened and he called our doctor’s personal phone to tell her what happened. She never contacted us to talk about it and did nothing to try remedy it. We weren’t planning on pressing charges, but we were firm that we were not going to pay for the ER visit. My wife went in for her 6 week check up and brought up the whole fiasco and the doctor said to her in person that she would take care of the ER visit and that we should pay anything. Well fast forward to today and turns out she never paid it and now we have a debt collector calling us on behalf of the hospital. Any advice?\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nThank you all so much for the support and advice! I am overwhelmed by the comments and feel very validated by my feelings of anger and frustration. My wife and I are gathering all of the information we can and are still discussing with each other exactly which order we are going to go about this. I truly wish I could post a picture in this sub to show you the needle, but I will link it to Imgur https:\/\/imgur.com\/yz1wn5L (if that is against the rules I can remove the link). My wife insisted that she got a picture of it as well as the board in the ER room that had the attending's name as well as the nursing staff. It was basically the entire needle, so I'm still baffled that the doc lost it in the first place. I will update again in the coming days!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Two words.  Malpractice Lawyer.

{"prompt":"So I recently stumbled upon my ex best friend’s TikTok video on my for you page. She started telling this story about how she used to have a best friend (me) that would constantly breakup and get back together with guys. She said that I was so obsessed with one, that he had to come out as gay so that he could “get rid of me” since I “threatened to kill myself, call the cops on him, and put him in jail” if he didn’t get back together with me. She said that our “relationship finally ended when he came out as gay.”\n\nI know that the story is about me, because my ex did come out as gay in high school, but as a joke to mess with me (he later on admitted it to me). By the time that he had came out as “gay”, I was already in a new relationship so I was nothing but surprised and supportive when I first heard about the news. I have tons of proof and concrete evidence that would debunk her story about me. \n\nMy ex’s current girlfriend, reached out to my ex best friend because she saw the TikTok video she made about me. My ex friend then made a follow up video saying that she talked to his new girlfriend on the phone for hours, and was getting the “tea on me”.  She said she found out that “I was a stalker that would randomly show up at his house when he wasn’t home, and that I installed Snapchat on his phone so that I could track his location without him knowing.” We dated from 2012-2015, and snap maps didn’t come out until 2017. So idk how I was possibly tracking his location on Snapchat back then?? \n\nShe didn’t name me in the video, but it genuinely hurt me to see someone whom I used to call by true best friend tell fake stories about me in order to gain more followers. I reached out to her, explained how the stories aren’t true, and politely asked if she could take down the videos. Of course she ignored me. All of the comments are saying that “I’m psycho”, and “give off Jodi Arias vibes”. \n\nI want to defend myself, but I’ve never made a TikTok video in my life, and I don’t know if it’s worth it to even expose her and her lies.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Just ignore her. Since she never names you it doesn’t really affect you.

{"prompt":"Me (19M) and my dad (52M) live together in a condo. My mom (53F) and him are separated, if that matters.\n\nFor context, here is how our living room in the condo is set up: both my dad's and my PC setups are in the living room, facing toward opposing walls.\n\nAnyway, I come home to the condo after a doctor's appointment. I go and sit down at my desk as usual. My dad and I are conversing about my appointment, just usual casual talk. While we're talking, he looks away casually to look at the kitchen (away from the living room), and I look away at the same time at his computer screen. He already has a bad habit of keeping applications open on his computer, even when he is away or asleep.\n\nAt a glance, I see pornography. I personally don't think much of it, because it isn't a crime to have porn. The man is single, so hey, everyone needs to get off sometimes. However, it did look strange. It was a paused video on an MP4 player, in a small window on his computer. He has other windows open too, but it's just normal casual Youtube stuff.\n\nI don't think he noticed that I saw what was on his screen. In fact, I don't even think he knew it was on his screen. He probably thought he closed it earlier or something.\n\nHe says he's going to get ready to play pool, so he goes to his room and the bathroom. While he's away,  I take a closer look at what's on his screen, and sure enough... it's of a little boy. Like no debate, it is of an underage child.\n\nI wanted to throw up and cry, I didn't think he would do anything like this. If there's one file, there's more on his hard drive for sure, right?\n\nI needed to play it off that I never noticed, once he comes back and tells me he's leaving to go play pool. So I hop on a game on my own computer to make it seem like I was too distracted by my own gaming to even notice what's on his computer screen across the room behind me. About 20 minutes later, he comes out, turns off his computer, and says he's leaving, all while I'm playing the game. It seems that it worked.\n\nI told my mother about what happened. I'm staying at my mom's place now. She seems to have the perspective about how to keep the family together, but I personally think this is already past a family matter. This isn't a victimless crime. I don't even know how long this has been going on. He's always been a good father to me, but I feel so disgusted. Has he ever looked at me the same way he looks at those little boys? How does he even acquire this stuff?\n\nWhat should I do? Should I file an anonymous claim? Should I confront him? Tell him to seek help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy girlfriend (19F) comes over on the weekends sometimes, and she prefers staying at my dad's condo than my mom's house, as there's more to do. I haven't told her anything about what I discovered about my father. I don't feel comfortable bringing her to the condo, especially if she's sleeping over. What should I tell her, if anything?\n\nAlso, my dad's own father has a history of pedophilia as well. My dad grew up to hate and despise him, as he abused and molested his own children. I feel that my dad, who knows well how child abuse and pedophilia can ruin a family, should know so much better than to do this.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" report him anonymously. Stay at your moms.

Simply tell her to stop tickling you. If she tries to sit on your leg again tell her to get up. You should also start leaving the room if she doesn’t stop, and\/or asking her parents or other adults to come get her. Example: “Aunt Mary, can you come get Susan? She won’t stop tickling me!” You do that enough times and the adults will see she has a crush and make her stop these behaviors.\n\nYou are a minor yourself, but at 17 and male the onus is on you to curtail any of her acting out on you.

I have an autoimmune disorder that makes it very likely I’ll experience some kind of complications and possibly die during pregnancy. I also don’t have strong maternal instincts and hate being around small children.\n\nI told my bf that somehow I was pregnant and I would be going to the doctor as soon as possible to schedule an abortion. (They are legal in my country before 20-30 weeks) \nBut when I got back home today my bfs parents were there and both of them hugged me and congratulated me on “finally getting pregnant.” And were so excited to be grandparents. I had to tell them “I’m sorry, but it’s not safe for me to keep a baby. I don’t want children and we aren’t in a financial place to have one.”\nMy bfs mom started crying and there was a lot of yelling back and forth about it.\n\nI finally said “it’s my body so I have the final say. I will not put my life or my future at risk just so you can have grandchildren.” I than got into my car and drove to my parents house where I have been for the past few days.\n\nMy bf keeps calling me trying to convince me to keep the baby and his parents keep texting me begging me to not “kill their grand baby”.

{"prompt":"Hello! I really need some help.\n\nI was informed this morning, pictures of me (specifically images only shown to friends and former friends of mine) are being used on a really sketchy website are being used for a profile on a sex chat website.\n\nI am 14 years old, and the page says I'm 21. I didn't even make it.\n\nIt also says that I'm \"In constant need of good cock\" in the profile on the website's bio- despite me literally being a child.\n\nI think I might know who have done it. My boyfriend had this really toxic friend. This guy, we'll call him L, would do horrible things to him. L would constantly insult his and I's relationship, would make fun of my boyfriend's appearance and interests, and would do stuff like photoshop my boyfriend into images of Hitler. Eventually, after me and my boyfriend had a talk about how he was being used by L, my boyfriend cut ties with him completely. L thinks because of this that I'm, in his own words, a \"Manipulative whore\". L is 15 or 16.\n\nWhat do I do? Should I keep evidence for law enforcement? I feel like if my mom knew this is happening, she wouldn't let me show my face online (Which for me helps with my low self confidence).\n\nIs there any specific authorities to contact, should I just ignore it? It doesn't use my real name, and nobody online except my boyfriend knows my full name- and he hasn't shared it.\n\nPlease Reddit, what do I do? I need help. I don't want this to ruin my future jobs because employers might think its me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Firstly, thank you for all of the support. I don't check reddit often but coming back to this made me cry a little. I was able to get the images down without telling my mom or the cops. Firstly I contacted all the people who had that picture of my face that was being used (only some people have seen it) and I told them if it wasn't down I would take legal action. Simultaneously, I found the sites owners and took the advice of making a sockpuppet email, taking the advice someone gave me to write as an infuriated parent. I threatened legal action against the site, which I'm surprise this did anything seeing as it seems to be based in India. Right after I contacted those people, they changed the profile picture on the website to some random anime loli (ew). And about two days later, the account was banned from the site. Thank you all so much for the kind words and advice. I don't know what I would do without this advice, seeing as (partially due to my autism) I was scared and panicked and felt myself shutting down whenever I thought about it. I don't know who specifically did it still, but my boyfriend and I have cut ties with the group of assholes (L and his friends) that were most likely responsible. Him and I are doing wonderfully, and our 11 month anniversary is on the 30th. He's been more happy and carefree now that he's away from those dickheads- and I don't care if they think I'm manipulative. I know that keeping them away from him is what's best for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of you seem to think the pictures were pornographic in nature for some reason?? They were not. It was an image of my face and another of me holding a rooster at a local farm.

He's nuts, has threatened to shoot us, has beaten both of us, and he's even told me that if we ever got in a fight and he lost he would pick up something or grab a gun and kill me. Every person we talk to says the same thing, if he's so awful just call the police. It's not that simple, at least it doesn't feel that simple. We're both worried that he'd shoot the police, and even when they've gotten involved they've never been of any help, saying not to call unless he is in our apartment.\n\nToday he came through the door in a bitchy mood as always, yelling about how much he needs my help to fix up his house but that I never go there.

That's when it all started.\n\nI started to yell back, saying that I filled out the form the same way I filled out mine. He starts getting in my face, and saying \"You wanna fight, let's take it outside\". We continue screaming back and forth, until he decides he's gonna leave. As he's walking out the door he's popping off more shit about how sorry I am, and I guess I just snap. I remember grabbing him by the throat and throwing him to the ground. I even remember after he went limp I still kept strangling him and screaming \"DIE MOTHER FUCKER! DIE! DIE!\" over and over again. I opened the door and started dragging him outside, his head hitting the concrete as I did.\n\nFinally after a bit he woke up, his face was bleeding and he kept asking us what happened. I kept screaming at him \"You opened up your smart mouth for the last fucking time!\", and other stuff. I ran out to the back porch and started to try and calm down. My hands wouldn't stop shaking, and I started to cry. I had completely lost it, and if I hadn't of let go when I did I may have killed him. I'm going to see my counselor tomorrow and talk to him about this, I feel so awful and scared that I was close to going too far. I hate him so much, I just wish he'd leave us alone. But with how stupid and stubborn he is he'll probably show back up in a few days and act like nothing ever happened. What should I do?

I understand the terrible fear of feeling so helpless, so powerless to change a situation, and that terrifying feeling that you could lose control of your faculties. I think it’s great that you’re going to see a counselor, it’s imperative that you have someone you can talk to about the situation and about what’s going on inside you. Trying to bottle it all up is basically a guarantee that you’ll lose control at some point, in some way. \n\nClearly your father needs to be cut out of your life and your mom’s life completely, and as soon as possible.

{"prompt":"I remember when I was a teenager, just a picture of a naked Pam Anderson was enough to get me going for days. The fact that she had big fake canonball tits didn't bother me at all. Nothing really did. Everything was exciting.\n\nBut as the years have gone on, I find I am impressed less and less. This has likely been exacerbated by my training and job as a doctor. I have now over the past 10 years seen and done things medically to so many people that likely go beyond the scope of what any normal person outside of my field or perhaps a sex worker would experience in their life span.\n\nThis goes for both men and women's bodies. \n\nThere was a time giving a rectal\/prostate exam to a man would make me mildly uncomfortable. Now I've stuck my finger in so many people's asses of both genders it's pretty much a completely neutral experience. Not much different than listening to a heartbeat.\n\nI've seen thousands of people in various states of undress. \n\nI've done countless manual pelvic exams on women to feel for pelvic muscle dysfunction, infections, cervix abnormalities, and ovarian masses. I've done so many speculum exams for paps I couldn't begin to count. Ditto with breast exams.\n\nI know what the spectrum of human anatomy looks and feels like inside and out from birth to 90 years old and everywhere between.\n\nI know people would probably like to believe this isn't the case,  but when you start out in this type of field you're not machine-like. There was a time even the notion of doing a breast exam made my heart beat a bit faster. The first pap I did my heart was pounding so much just from nervousness and also I hadn't really seen many women naked at all at that time. Now it's literally just tissue to be sorted through and analyzed. The only nervousness I have now is if I will be making the person I'm examining uncomfortable or not.\n\nThe neutralization of the body in my mind probably makes me more ideal as a doctor. Most people would like a doctor who sees them as a neutral body. But I think it's changing my perspective on dating and sex too. Porn has become boring. Masturbation is boring. Dating is boring.\n\nI was out at a club grinding with a girl and while my dick got hard from it, that was really just an involuntary response. I didn't really actually care the whole time. I kept thinking she needed to lose 10 lb as I felt her hips because (1) all I do all day is try to find and analyze physical flaws and what people can do to be healthier and (2) I've seen and been around so much it's almost impossible for anyone to really be impressive to me physically.\n\nI remember when I was a resident working in a breast clinic, one of the husbands of a patient made a joking comment about how it must be an amazing job to just feel up women's breasts all day. I think that's how other men might see it. But that's not the reality at this point. For example, I calculated and I will have to do over 40 hours of paps (which often also include a breast exam as that is the most opportune time to screen both) in the next 2-3 months to catch up my patient population for the year. It's literally just a chore that will eat into the rest of my schedule and it's going to be a grind to get them all booked in and done.\n\nHow do you get excited about sex or dating when the human body has literally become just a chore to you?\n\nIt seems to me like you can't have it both ways. If the human body is exciting and new then you're not the objective and neutral doctor people want. And once you've seen so much it becomes boring then how do you excited about it again?\n\nI guess maybe this is just an inevitable change that occurs from doing this sort of thing. I really don't know. I just know it's hard to get excited about dating or sex when almost nothing excites you anymore. I kind of miss the days when the body was an exciting and uneasy thing. That uneasiness is where sexual tension, fantasy, and desire comes from.\n\nHow do you have those things once the mystery is pretty much completely gone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is actually very comforting.\n\n  \nI had a new doctor once and had to show him an itch on my anus.  \nI cannot tell you how embarrassed I felt. \n\nHe of course, didn't seem to care and told me he'd seen a couple thousand anuses before.  \nI hadn't shown my anus to anyone before.

She didn't cry like a couple of us had predicted, but she did give quite a few students hugs.

{"prompt":"I walked in on my cousin and my brother making out. I‘m 14, my brother is 15 and my cousin is 16 (all male). We’ve been close since childhood, always running around together and playing video games, yk, what kids do. In the past year I’ve noticed them getting closer, but ofc just thought they were bonding so I didn’t really suspect anything. Two days ago we all met at our yearly family gathering, it was really fun and I got to see a lot of people that I missed. My brother, my cousin and I decided that we want to stay at my grandparents house for a few more days so that we can hang out because we don’t see each other that much anymore. Yesterday, i went out for a little to get food from the store across the street. It took me a bit longer because we eat a LOT of snacks and it was like shopping for a family of 5. When I came back after around an hour or so I noticed it was quiet, which is very weird for us since we’re all very loud. I walked upstairs to the bedroom we shared to figure out why and when I opened the door my brother was on top on my cousin and they were making out. Like heavily making out. My brother wasn’t wearing a shirt and his hands were all over my cousin. I just kinda froze and they jumped apart. My cousin started crying and my brother instantly comforted him, he himself also tearing up. I awkwardly stood before walking out. I just kinda sat on the porch for a bit, processing what just happened. My brother came out of the house and we awkwardly sat in silence for a while before he spoke up. He said “I know it’s weird but me and [name] really love each other. I’m sorry you found out this way.” And walked off. It’s been really awkward and I don’t know what to do. I don’t really know how I feel about it either. I, for one, didn’t know either of them were gay. I’m in no way homophobic, my girlfriend is bi and I have a lot of gay friends who I support fully, although I am straight (I think). But secondly, we are literally related. Our dads are brothers, and I see both of them as brothers. I mean they’re happy, but yet again oh my god. Im definitely not going to tell anyone in our family, I don’t want to ruin their relationship even if it’s a bit weird. But I also don’t know, I feel like our relationship isn’t going to be the same, and I kinda don’t want to be that close to them anymore, which makes me feel bad. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: I talked to them earlier and we had a long discussion about it. I told them that I do support them being gay, but I’m not sure about their relationship. They said they understood and I asked for a bit of space. I also promised them that I won’t tell an adult, or anyone I know irl for that matter. I asked how long they had been a thing and they said 11 months, so it’s been going on a for a bit. I told them I was happy that they found love but am slightly weirded out. Im currently not talking to either for them for at least a few days and just taking my time to think, Ty for the advice!\n\nAlso, for all the people assuming I’m in the US and stuff, I’m German, live there and all this is happening in Germany.

I can't be in our front yard, and I have to ask if I want to go into the backyard. \n\nWe have a phone turn-in. And it's at 10, and I have TONS of child locks on my phone.

Place to sleep, food, hygiene, this can be either living from your car, buying grocery store meals and showering at the local gym or staying at a friends\/ extended family house. If your home is bad enough, try and see if you can join a homeless of women's shelter till you've got a job.\n\nOnce you get a roof above your head, you'll need a job to continue having a roof above your head and save money for your own space. This will be hard, especially while shutting off your parents at the same time and it's up to you to see if the situation requires this. There isn't really a quick and easy solution. Focus on getting housing, money is just an easier way to get and keep housing. Buying a car might be an easier short term solution  \n\n\ntl;dr you need to find a way to save money, or be able to live somewhere rent-free till you can make money END"}

[Please look at this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/clzgkk\/update_my_mom_sold_my_dog_against_my_will_and_i\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) \n\n\n[SMALL UPDATE BELOW]\n\nI’m 16yo, male.\nI had an amazing, very well behaved one year old Akita dog that I spent basically the whole day with...she was pretty protective of me, and she was large. Although she was an angel with amazing behavior, and whenever my family came to interact with her, she was pretty nice although they didn’t stick around much...only interacting with her for a few minutes before leaving, I was basically the only person taking care of her, but I loved it, and I loved her.\n\nThen my mom told me she wants to sell my dog. She said it was way too large and scary looking and she wanted a dog that “could be compared to a cat, and treated like one”.  I had no choice in the matter and a week later, my dog was gone. A lady came to pick her up and I had the task of crating her and such...I put my dog in the lady’s car, and she and my mom went inside to discuss some stuff. I ran to the kitchen and got some boiled chicken, the treat I usually give her. I sat in the ladys car with my dog for a bit, giving her plenty of chicken and petting her with my fingers through the bars of the crate, so she wouldn’t be scared on the car ride as much...\n\n\nThen, when mom and the lady came back and the lady drove off, my dog was gone.\nI didn’t really feel anything. I was just kinda like...I guess another dog it is...\n\nA week passed, and I was actively just waiting for a new dog. It felt so weird not having anything to take care of. Of course, I did miss my dog...but I didn’t feel sad, I was just feeling “void”, nothing. If that makes sense.\n\nMom came home with a new three month old small puppy, a white terrier. About a week has passed since I owned him, and I’m his primary caretaker.  Of course, I love him and he’s been a sweetheart, although needing a lot of training that I’m working on at the moment..but my family has been wanting him with them a lot more than my old dog. They sometimes come to me and tell me to leave the dog with them for a bit, all of my family call him cute when he does certain things. He’s...scarily similar to my Akita dog in the way he acts. But instead of freezing up or being indifferent to his actions like they were with my Akita, they call him cute n stuff...even though he’s acting very similarly to my old Akita, he’s just small and non-threatening I guess. But I would get this very irriater feeling in my gut when I see how my family treats this dog so differently even when my Akita did the same thing...you know, jumping in excitement, micro borks when playing, running around excitedly, being happy to see me, standing, dog stuff. \n\nThe more time I spent with this dog, the more he just kept reminding me of my Akita. I’ve been getting more and more depressed just thinking ahout it while I’m taking care of him since he reminds me so much of her...\n\n\nOne day, I was trying to get my new dog to sleep. I was in my room and he was on his bed, but he was being very anxious and hasn’t slept well. I was determined to make him sleep at least a little that day. I knew he trusted me, so I just did some stuff. Played relaxing music, sat with him silently while he slept, comforted him, a lot of stuff. Still, though, he’d suddenly jerk awake every 15 minutes or so at the slightest sound, and then he would see me, I’d pet him and he’d almost immediately plop down to sleep. This kept reminding me when I was doing the same thing to my Akita dog when she was anxious and didn’t sleep at all for a whole day almost...She was waking up at each sound, just like this new dog was, and the way I was treating this new dog to get him to sleep was exactly what I did to my Akita. \n\n\nSo I was theee, literally just sitting there in silence making sure he actually gets to sleep. He’d wake up every 15 minutes. All the while, I’m silently just...being reminded of my Akita. I was holding back tears though, because I had to be silent for my dog to sleep.\nBut...he never did. He kept jerking awake every 15 minutes. After about an hour and a half of this, my dog jerked awake one final time. It gave me flashbacks to when my Akita did the same thing. After I tended to him and got him sleeping again, as soon as he laid down and closed his eyes, It was too much. I was remembering my Akita too much. I couldn’t take it anymore and started crying. Apparently it was LOUD. I didn’t even realize, but according to my mother, she heard it from the second floor when she came to check on me. I thought nobody would be able to hear me even outside my door, but apparently I was crying extremely uncontrollably. I didn’t tell my mom why I cried, though.\n\nI have the number of the lady who had my dog, and I called her every now and then to ask how my Akita was...she never answered. It always times out. My mother is refusing to give me any details and just says she has her and she’s fine. What the hell do I do? I love my new dog yes, but I’m such a wreck right now...I can’t even interact with my new dog for a long time because I just remember my Akita, get depressed  and feel like crying. Thankfully, others are happy to take him off my hands temporarily whenever I need a break...though, they’re the one asking me to take him for a bit.\n\nI just don’t know. What do I do?\n\n\n[UPDATE]\n\n\nA lot has happened in these two hours, actually.\n\nYesterday I asked my mom why the person who bought my dog wasn’t responding, she hesistated for 3 seconds and said she re-sold sold the dog and she forgot to told me. I didn’t believe her.\nThe reason I was calling the person who bought my dog was because she said I could visit her and ask her for updates. I also had a mini interview with her about how she’d treat the dog, and she came out fine. Though, I just called her for the second time today, and she finally responded. She did confirm that she sold my dog. When I asked her if that meant I couldn’t visit, she said “Obviously. I don’t know where she is”.  I continued that conversation a bit talking about how I should have made it clear in our agreement that I would get to visit her, and that it was my bad that I didn’t specify.\n\n\nLater, my mom called me. She asked me why I called TPWBMD. I told her I just wanted to know what was up for sure. She explained to me that she told me everything yesterday and that TPWBMD said I was bothering her by calling constantly. She also said that this made her look like a bad mother because now TPWBMD thinks my mom didn’t tell me about what she did to my dog, which she didn’t until I explicitly asked her.\n\nAfter that, I kinda hatched a plan. I called our vet and pretended that I somehow lost the microchip digits of my dog, and if they could tell me the code so I could write it down in her dog passport. They asked me if I had the dog, I lied and said yes. They said I can just bring her in and they’d scan and give me the code. I pretended that I was too lazy to, and said if it was possible if I provided details.\n\nAfter confirming my name, phone number, my dogs name, breed, etc, they knew I was the guy with her at the vet for sure. After 30 minutes, I was told the tracking chip code.\n\nI went all over the internet looking for the contact info of the new owner of my dog. It seems it doesn’t exist. I think I have to wait until the guy who newly owns her puts his info on the tracking chip, then I can input that into some website and I’ll get his contact info and maybe he will agree to update me on my Akita regularly. Or hell...maybe visit? I wish with all my heart this goes well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I kind of hate your Mom. It made me so mad to read this.

{"prompt":"So here’s the story. When I was 17 my uncle started messaging me online and responding to my photos, he’d send me fire emojis and heart eyes. I thought this was weird and spoke to my mom about it who then told me not to worry. On my 18th birthday he told me he was so happy I was 18, but again, I thought nothing of it because my mom told me not to. For the next year it continued with him sending me emojis and I’d reply because, well, he’s my uncle.\n\nThen one day he got ahold of my Snapchat and as weird as I thought it was, I accepted his request. He’d send me regular snapchats of his day-to-day life and I would typically reply with smiley face emojis, never really starting up conversation because I just felt as though something was off.\n\nFlash forward, I got my first nude. I skipped through the Snapchat so quickly that I convinced myself I had imagined it. Then came the videos. Disgusting videos of him touching himself and moaning my name. I went to my mom and (not surprising considering my family) she didn’t believe me and said I would need proof before she believed me.\n\nI screenshotted all of the photos he sent to me that very night and showed my mom, who made excuse after excuse about how somebody must have photoshopped the photo and was pretending to be my uncle. When I convinced her it was real, she told my aunt and the two went to confront him. I don’t know what happened the night they both confronted him but my mom came home that night telling me that I needed to forgive him and move on because he is family, and it wasn’t as if he touched me or raped me.\n\nThis weekend is Easter, and although I have not had too much contact with my family since the incident, they expect me to be there for Easter. They have invited my uncle and it disgusts me. I do not want to see him however, although I do not live with my mom she helps support me when I can’t afford my bills and I’m afraid she will stop if I don’t show up to Easter. I don’t know what to do.\n\nI also don’t know what can be done about my uncle seeing as I was 18 when the photos were sent to me. I need advice because I am stressing over Easter and don’t know if I can handle seeing my uncle or my family who is unsympathetic to how I feel.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" go to easter dinner and hold up the phone of the photos to let your entire family know just what type of sick person he is.

I talked to him all yesterday explaining that I was really hurt and I wish he could love me and accept me for who I was and I just wanted him to understand my feelings and make me feel better. Which he did. At the end of the day I love him and I did tell him I would try for him and us to dress less reveling.

He just wanted to get his point across and I am stubborn and head strong and that’s the only way he thought to get me to understand how I dress really was important to him. I told him I was really angry and needed time and didn’t want to see him. He got super mad but understood. This morning I woke up in a great (I don’t give a f*ck what other people think) kind of mood and I just went for a walk and went to a cute coffee shop and went to a farmer’s market. He saw it on Instagram and texted me that I’m just happy without him in my life and he couldn’t believe I didn’t invite him to do those things with me. I explained that I just want to be myself and I want to be happy, have fun, be silly and live my life.

{"prompt":"To say I was mad as hell would be an understatement. I (46M) have a son Jake (23M & Fake Name). Jake was a good kid growing up. So him doing this was a complete shock to me. I have a daughter too, Amber (16F & Also Fake Name). When my wife passed away from Covid nearly two years ago, she already had a will in place. She was immunocompromised due to a prior condition she was diagnosed with a decade before she passed. And she made sure she had a will set just in case anything happened to her. And in said will she divided her assets between our children. And Jake got his cut as he was already 21. He used that money to put a down payment on a condo, and he also got his mother's car. But the will stated that my daughter was to get all of my wife's jewelry. That included a vintage gold ring with a diamond that had a light blue sapphire on each side of it. That ring has been passed down for generations in my wife's family. It was originally her grandmother's wedding band. Her husband was a jeweler and hand crafted the ring for her himself. And it was passed down to my wife's mother when her grandmother died, and then to my wife herself when her mother passed. And it along with the other jewelry was to all go to my daughter.\n\nWhen my wife passed away, my grief was intense. But I powered through it for the sake of my family. And they supported me 100%. So the betrayal from my son was just a rusty knife in the back to me. For the past eight months Jake has been dating Sara (Fake name). She has my son wrapped around her finger. And she loves jewelry as she adorns herself with it a lot. My son mentioned the family jewels my wife left his sister to Sara one day, and Sara really wanted to see them. So Jake went into my room when no one was home and showed them to her. He later admitted to me that he'd done this, and I was angry. But I thought that would be the end of it. I was wrong. Jake came to me a week ago and begged for that ring from his mother's family jewels so that he could propose with it. He said Sara had fallen in love with the ring when she saw it before, and he just knew it'd be the perfect ring to ask her to marry him with. He seemed completely convinced I'd be jumping for joy for him wanting to propose. But instead, I told him that I was not the one to ask as the ring belongs to Amber. And I wouldn't have him pressuring her to give it up it either. For a fair chance, I'd allow him to explain his reasons and ask her for it once. But only once. Without pressuring her. And if she refuses for any reason, that will be the end of it. Jake agreed and asked Amber for the ring right in front of me. But she told him no because she wanted to keep it in the family jewels, and has always loved that ring. To her, it's priceless. She couldn't bear to ever give it up. I told Jake that was that, and to not press the matter further.\n\nJake left looking very unhappy about not getting the ring. But I thought he'd let it go and look into finding a similar one. But he came back another day while I was at work to talk to his sister after she got home from school. He and Amber got into a huge fight about the ring and Amber called me crying. I called Jake and told him to get out of my house and leave his sister alone. Jake yelled at me that he should have just as much right to the ring as his sister, because my wife was his mother too. But I reminded him he got a lot of his mother's money, and her car. The jewelry is Amber's, and only hers. He hung up on me and Amber soon texted me that he left very angry.\n\nLater right before I left work, my daughter called and told me that Jake came back. He walked in dressed in a suit, went into my room and took something. Then left without saying anything to Amber. She tried to keep him from leaving, but he shoved her out of the way. I rushed home as soon as my shift was over and checked my wife's jewelry box. The ring was gone. I immediately called Jake, but he didn't answer. So I messaged him that I'll get police involved if he doesn't return the ring. Using it to propose won't stop me from taking it back. That finally made him talk to me, and he tried to say that I couldn't do that to him because he's my son. I said I can and will because he outright stole the ring. And he'd better bring it back right away, or I would take drastic measures. Well he phoned me right after that, and in a whisper he said that it was too late. He'd taken his girlfriend out to dinner and proposed to her with the ring. He hadn't had it for more than an hour by this point. Yet the ring was already on her finger. I said that was his problem. He stole the ring, he can bring it back. It's not his, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure it's returned. And if that means going to police and blowing the whole situation up, then so be it. I'll file a report, I'll even get a lawyer. Jake started crying and saying I couldn't do this to him. I told him tough luck. He stole from both his sister and dead mother. I would not back down until the ring was returned.\n\nJake wouldn't stop crying and making excuses. So I told him to have the ring back by morning, or I would be moving forward with legal action. Jake is my son, but he still broke the law. And I couldn't overlook what he did. He said he'd be by in the morning to talk, and ended the call while crying even more. Well Jake did show up in the morning, and brought his girlfriend with him to try and guilt us. Turns out she not only knew he stole the ring, she wanted to keep it anyway. Because she was completely in love with the ring since she first laid eyes on it. I told her I didn't care. She could have a jeweler make a copy of it or something. But the original doesn't belong to her, it belongs to my daughter and deceased wife. Jake begged me one more time not to make her give it back. But I and my daughter stood firm. Return the ring or face police and maybe even a potential lawsuit. Jake's girlfriend pulled the ring off her finger and dropped it in my daughter's hands, called me an evil bastard, then left my house in tears. Jake started screaming at me that I may have just destroyed his relationship. I retorted him that he did this to his own relationship by stealing a ring that didn't belong to him. What kind of son steals from his own sister and dead mother? That is beyond terrible! Jake had nothing more to say to me and walked out to follow after his girlfriend.\n\nI didn't get anyone else involved in the situation. But Jake did. He tried getting support from friends and family. But he got the exact opposite reaction he'd hoped for. They were all mad at him over what he'd done. I got many phone calls and message from people offering me condolences and saying they were not on Jake's side. I tried to do damage control. But now everybody knows. It's been a week now, and Jake's refused to speak to me. I've sent him detailed pictures of the ring, just in case he wanted a jeweler to replicate it. But making a copy would be very expensive unless he used fake stones. And thus far there has been no response. I don't know what the situation is with his girlfriend. If she even still is his girlfriend after what happened. But I still stand by the fact that Jake had to return the ring. I have since had all my wife's jewelry placed in a safety deposit box that only I have access to. And the jewelry will remain there until my daughter is 21. And may even stay there if she wants to keep it safe that way.\n\nI know I'm in the right to have reclaimed the ring. However I don't want my son to hate me. And I don't want the family to hate him. If anyone has any advice as to how to better mediate this situation without me giving away the ring or spending a lot of money, I'm all ears. \n\nEdit: Fixed a slight name mix-up. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" Jeez, man.

We became close to the point that we’re flatmates this year bc our mutual friend offered rooms in a flat but sometimes she would overstep my boundaries..\n\nOne time after I had only just met her, she called me at 3am bc she had gone out and she didnt know where she was altho she was obviously with her friend and a few other people (which i had seen on some peoples snapchat stories including hers), I was scared going out that late at night to look for her but I eventually found her and she was drunk, I brought her to her room, fed her, gave her water and tucked her in but she followed me to mine and said she couldnt sleep alone and I told her I wasn’t comfortable sharing my room\/bed with her. I don’t like other peoples touch besides my immediate family (not due to anything, it’s just how I’ve always been) and I also really dont like alcohol, even when my family consumes it, so I felt really uncomfortable with her there.\n*********TW: self harm\/scars*******\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI said no a few times and tried to turn her around but then she rolled up her sleeve and showed me her wrists and arms which had you-know-what and made me feel guilty which led me into letting her stay the night, I made sure I went on the other end of the bed as far away from her but she kept coming close and trying to hold my hand and hug me even after I tried to stop her. I ended up just laying there bc she wouldnt stop and I didn’t sleep the whole night because I felt sick and uncomfortable. I get that shes a person who likes physical touch but I told her I didnt like it and she ignored me.\n\nAfter that night I was thinking of avoiding her because she remembered everything and there was no legit excuse for what she did but I felt bad because I’m a naturally nice person and she only had 1 other friend so I continued to talk to her and keep her company but when I would be in my room she’d barge in and when I told her to leave while I got changed she refused to and instead said she’d look away or she’d throw a blanket over her head but I didnt like that. \n\nShe told me she was pansexual but she identifies more as gay which I was completely fine with until she continued trying to touch me and make me uncomfortable even when I blatantly told her I didn’t like touching or being near people often. I told her I was positively sure that I was heterosexual after a long time of thinking I was asexual but she always says that I’m gay whenever I compliment a girl on her looks, but it’s literally just a compliment and she doesnt get that and continues to insist that I’m “probably gay”.\n\nI’m already quite naturally irritable although I really push it down when I’m with “friends” which is why I usually give them a heads up before I isolate myself (because I like to be alone, it helps me think) but when I tell her she persists on coming in my room even tho I get visibly upset at being disturbed. One time she also slapped my butt which made me walk out and lock myself in my room and cry and  hyperventilate myself to sleep. She tries to hold my hand and touch me but I really really dont like physical touch unless its like an occasional hug from a long time friend or a formal handshake with a senior. \n\nI don’t like assuming things but I think she has a thing for me because I was talking to her cousins girlfriend who said this guy was interested in me (which I already didnt like the sound of) but he didnt want to make a move bc my friend had put a “claim” on me which honestly scared me. I’ve told her that I am not gay, I don’t like girls, I dont even really like boys but she PERSISTS that I like girls. It’s frustrating.. feels like when you try to tell your parents the truth but they dont believe you and think you’re lying.\n\nPlease help me. I want to properly sit down and express how I feel to her but I’ve tried that before and she doesn’t listen. It’s gotten to the point where I’m completely put off from our friendship and its made me so uncomfortable that everything she does or says makes me uneasy.

So she moved in with her dad, who WILL NOT allow any cats to live with him. She then asked if Ferguson (the cat) could stay with me, and I happily said yes of course.... that was 2 1\/2 years ago.

He agreed to babysit a cat and *five years* went by. Cute little black cat named Midnight, not a spot of white on him. Former Housemate paid for everything. Nothing was too good for Midnight, and the little guy became his baby. He had the tower, the built-in wall shelves, the automatic box, the robotic laser, the microchip, he went to the vet twice a year whether he needed it or not and often when he did, because Midnight had a health condition he was born with, the poor lovey. Former Housemate loved this cat to pieces.\n\nThen his friend returned with a carrier, expecting to get her cat back. After radio silence for four and three quarter years.\n\nI wouldn't say I heard his heart break, but it felt that way. He didn't say anything, just kind of stood there.\n\nThen my other former housemate, whom I had just married at the time, turned to Former Housemate and said \"Buddy, I think it's time you tell her the truth.\"\n\n\"Really? But-\"\n\n\"Midnight the First didn't make it, sweetheart. I am so sorry. [Former Housemate] did all he could for him, paid for everything at [Vet]'s office, but in the end, we had to put the little guy to sleep. You were away and we didn't know what you'd think, and [Former Housemate] just couldn't get over it, he missed the poor little guy so much, me and [Me] went and found another little cat at the county SPCA, looked as close as we could get to Midnight the First. Twoie, come here, boyo.\" And he made the treat sound, and Midnight obligingly came running.\n\nThe friend looked him over, sighed and remarked that she saw it now. Midnight II *did* look different up close. *Her* Midnight was smaller, had blue eyes, not gold, and his tail used to point more. Why, she couldn't take [Former Housemate's] cat. Twoie didn't even know her. She called him and called, and he just ignored her. So it was obvious that he was not her cat.\n\nSo we went out and had a beautiful wake for Midnight the First at the bar, paid for her drinks, and that was that.\n\nThe fact that all kittens' tails stop pointing, their eyes almost always change from blue and cats who have been cue-trained only come when called if given their cue...yeah, never seemed to occur to her. She'd just gotten a kitten, then gone on study abroad, then taught abroad, then taken some time to get back and not really learned all that much about Cat Facts. (I understand she came from dog people, so best not to hold it against her.)\n\nBut our former housemate? I reckon he'd hide a body, steal an election or go beat up God if my husband ever needed a favor, for saving his cat and his friendship for him. Also, Midnight started answering to Twoie sometimes and is fully seventeen years old these days, though only his human and vet know that. Socially, he admits to sixteen, for obvious reasons. Lovely little fellow, still small and black.\n\nIt's never a good idea to lie, but in a case where a person kind of remembers they have a cat and is sort of lowkey dreading the resumption of responsibility, while the other person dearly loves the cat and is dreading the fight to keep them, a third party providing a face-saving falsehood that lets both parties be satisfied with everyone's honor intact, effectively taking the blame for any hurt feelings onto their own karma, that can be one good fix.\n\nBut you'd need a hell of a fast-thinking friend, or a very common-looking cat.

Essentially she started dating this 18 year old guy we'll just call Devon 2 months ago. Devon rubbed me the wrong way instantly, he's a college football player of like 6'4 with blonde hair (Just imagine a stereotypical rich douche bag who plays football in school). When we first met he was trying to charm me the best he could with a disgustingly superficial mask. When I first went to dinner with his family and my daughter there were multiple red flags I spotted instantly when paying attention to their relationship dynamic. When Devon's parents asked her questions Devon would motion her to stop talking and then talk over her, he'd constantly tell my daughter what to do and when, he seemed super controlling. I did a background check on him and what do you know, he had a DUI from like 8 months ago when he had first turned 18.\n\nI had also noticed little things as well, such as one time I watched him drop my daughter off and he didn't know I was watching, and he was speeding at like 40 in a residential before dropping her off and peeling out like a douche. I really just don't like this kid and he seems EXACTLY like my ex wife who was a fucking psychotic bitch who made my life hell every day. Thing is, I can't really do dick about it. I'm not a prude, I make super explicit disturbing music for a living and have had a criminal past before so I ABSOLUTELY do not believe in trying to control or forcefully direct an almost adult into doing what I think is right for them.

{"prompt":"*I’m using a throwaway*\n\nLittle backstory: my parents always have an early thanksgiving gathering the weekend before, because my brother and 2 sisters work thanksgiving day. On Saturday we had our gathering at my parents house. I’m 22 (M) and I still live at home. My brother and sister in law just had a baby, and I haven’t ever really cared for her. My brother makes a stupid amount of money with his job, thus his wife makes it known that they are wealthy and walks with her nose in the air and acts like she is above me and my other siblings. She has always been mean to me, and even told my brother that if we wanted to hang out, it would have to be at my parents house because I would dirty their house, because I am 5 years old, after all. Anyway, the night of our gathering she had asked my mom where she could breast feed, and my mom told her to do it in my brothers old room, the room next to mine. She excused herself a few times and fed my nephew. During family gatherings, I always close my bedroom door, usually because it’s really dirty and I don’t want it to be an eye sore when people walk by it to use the bathroom. \n\nMy sister had gotten me a poster from her work for my birthday, and I went to go put it in my room, and when I opened the door my sister in law was sitting on MY chair in MY room, breast feeding my nephew. She literally screamed as if I had brought 3 of my friends to watch her. A, it was an accident and I had no intention of trying to watch her take out her boobs. B, she was in my room, I don’t think I have to knock before I enter MY room. My brother came to her rescue and she started screaming that I was a pervert and that I was probably waiting for the right moment to walk in on her. My brother asked me what my problem was and I said that I had no idea she was in there and that she was supposed to be in his room. She then said that my recliner was more comfortable for her to sit in. She then kept calling me a pervert and disgusting, so after arguing with them and pleading my case she and my brother left. Now I feel like she’s gonna be telling people that I did it on purpose, and she will probably spin it and say that I tried to take pictures or something. I have a girlfriend that I see naked so I wouldn’t want anything to do with her anyway. Not sure what I should do. I still have to see her for the remainder of the holidays, and even though I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s really bothering me. \n\nTLDR: my sister in law was breastfeeding in my bedroom without my knowledge, so I accidentally walked in on her with her boobs out, and she proceeded to scream at me and call me a pervert\n\n\nUpdate: I wanna say thanks for the advice. There’s been a lot of comments and I can’t read and reply to each one individually. I know there’s a better way to post updates but I don’t have the time or energy to do that. So here’s an update since last night. My mom told me she talked to my sister in law, and told her she didn’t appreciate that outburst in our house. That I had every right to go into my bedroom and that she should have asked before going in there. According to my mom, she responded semi-well to that and she said she may have overreacted. That may have been my mom trying to get me to be less anxious about it, but I will try to take her word for it. My brother and I are meeting up this weekend and I’m gonna help him move stuff out of his basement so that’ll be the perfect time to hash things out. She will be gone, so she can’t interfere. A lot of comments dragged my brother, and yes, he was the asshole who could have defused things by defending me and telling her to calm down. I told him I would only help him and talk to him if he promises not to be an ass and let me tell my side. Also a lot of people said this was fake?? I know throwaway accounts are usually trolling but i swear this is not fake!! I wouldn’t want anyone to be put in this awkward and anxious situation, especially with family and I don’t know who would lie about something like this??Another thing, people want to know what my girlfriend thought, she was upset and angry just like me. She said that it wasn’t fair how she treated me and that it makes her disappointed in my brothers lack of understanding. So that’s how things are now. Hopefully my brother listens to what I have to say.

{"prompt":"My sister plays Minecraft on my PC, since I’m in college and I left my desktop at the house. I came back from school just this weekend, and was using my computer, when I found the “discord” chat app. Originally, I didn’t think much of it, and assumed it was for her to talk to her friends when she plays.\n\nI looked through her chats, and found a person she has been talking to since May 15th, called “chatline.” As I scrolled up I found out that she was sending nude pictures, and videos, to this guy who seems to be around the age of 17 (I found his Instagram).\n\nHe says thing like “I’m going to cut myself if you don’t reply to me,” and sends gifs of sexual positions he wants to try with my sister. I could hardly even look at what I was reading.\n\nIt appears as though they are dating online. I am completely shocked and can’t believe that this is happening. My sister has been manipulated and exposed to things she just shouldn’t be around at 12 years old.\n\nI’m really stuck and don’t know what to do. On the one hand I could tell my parents, but I don’t want to ruin the relationship between my sister and them, or I could talk to her directly. I want to report this guy she’s talking to as a child predator, but I don’t know what is best to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The **BEST** case here is that the person she's talking to is \"just\" a pedophile.\n\nConsider the weight of that statement for a moment.\n\nThe alternative explanation is that this person is engaging in typical grooming behavior. Trying to acclimate children into sexual behavior and building dependence, using the relationship to gather images that are sold in child pornography black markets, and ultimately leveraging that to cause them to \"visit\" the groomer (which can result in kidnapping, rape, and\/or sex trafficking).\n\nDo not ignore this.

{"prompt":"A week ago he (40m) picked me (15f) up from school and then started to stare at me but at my chest, i told him to focus on the road and he did until he pulled over and put his hand on my thigh and started to go up to my crotch, I got really frightened then he stopped and went back home like nothing happened. I stayed in my room the whole day after that and felt scared whenever i was around him, he later came to me and apologized and said if i ever told anyone it would be my fault if he got in trouble, so i kept shut about it. Then the day after that he did it again but put his hand my t shirt and touched my boobs saying he was giving me a massage, I tried to get away from him and show discomfort but he wouldn’t let go, i was shaking after that. I don’t know what to do because everyone sees him as a good man and wouldn’t believe me\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I’m so sorry. Do you have a mother? Do you think she would help?\n\nIf you think your mother would react harshly, I would tell a teacher asap.\n\nThis is not your fault. Your father is disgusting and horrible. END"}
{"prompt":" I've known him for a long time, he's become increasingly unstable over the past year. He thinks \"the jews\" are spying on him and listening to his conversations through his phone. He's smart, but fucking crazy. He told me he wants to do this and he's flying to new york and has bought his plane ticket. He's told me he wants to die young and be remembered. He's friends with neo nazis and he hasn't taken his anti-psychotics in months. Please help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Police. Immediately. \nI would alert the police nearby, so they can arrest him, as well as the police near the synagogue in question.\nPlease please do this RIGHT NOW. Reddit is not the place for questions like this - law enforcement needs to be involved ASAP. You could end up saving dozens or hundreds of lives - and if you DON'T contact law enforcement, you would be partially responsible for those deaths. \nI'm Jewish, but would say the same regardless of who he wanted to kill\/harm. So many mass shootings could be prevented by someone like you taking action. If you're afraid to handle this on your own, please at least provide us with some information so someone can tip off the police. This is terrifying. END"}
{"prompt":"A few nights ago I was working late at a restaurant where I live. I had to close the store and I didn’t get home until 11:00PM. Myself and my boyfriend started watching TV when I got home and I started to get ready for bed. I just finished brushing my teeth when my phone read 12:14AM and I was receiving a call from my father who lives 3 hours away from me. I initially knew it was strange for him to be calling me that hour. \n\nWhen I picked up the phone my father was severely crying. I’ve never heard him cry before so I found this very strange. I felt my heart sink to my feet. I could tell he was very intoxicated as well. He was telling me that his wife of 12 years (my step-mother) had left the house earlier that day due to an argument they had. Then he started talking about how she has been cheating on him for awhile. I had no idea this was happening and I was very shocked. He began to bring up his will to me and said if anything happens to him to please not forget him. He said Father’s Day is soon coming and he didn’t want me to forget him. \n\nHe then started to cry more severely. He was crying so hard that I could barely understand what he was saying. I told him to repeat what he said which was “I’m in the garage with the rifle. I’m going to blow my brains out now. I wanted to call and hear your voice for one last time.” My boyfriend jumped out of bed and went into the other room and started speaking to the police where my father lives. \n\nWhile I was waiting for the police to arrive I had to stall my father from shooting himself. I brought up anything I could think of. My faucet in my kitchen is leaky so I asked if he could come fix it. I ended up having to stall him for 1 hour and 20 minutes before the police showed up. He did live. I stalled him long enough for the police to take him to the hospital. The police seized the firearm and told me when they went into the garage he had a bed made out of towels and clothes. They said this must have been planned. They also said the rifle was fully loaded. My father had also drank a 26oz of whiskey, half a flask of whiskey, and a tallboy of beer.\n\nHe has been admitted for 72 hours as that is protocol. He got released yesterday and I’ve never felt so worried in my entire life. My step-mother has not showed any concern as she only picked him up from the hospital to bring him home. She did not stay at the house with him last night and it was his first night home. \n\nEveryone has been telling me that I saved his life. I honestly feel like I haven’t done anything. I can’t see any good In this situation. I’m terrified.  I cannot travel to where he lives because I have a job where I am. I would not be able to pay my rent. I offered to go get him and bring him to my city. He has friends where I live and I believe it would be good for him. He refused and said he doesn’t want to go anywhere because he needs to fix his car. He also said he needs to figure out what he is going to do with his house. I want to be with him but I can’t. I’m so scared. I don’t know how I will ever stop worrying about this.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tell your dad how much you love him and find a day to visit him.\n\nTell him you understand his problems even if you dont.\n\nHe feels all alone in this painful world and when he was about to leave it, he called you. I think that says a lot about what you should think. END"}
{"prompt":"My “best friend” (i don’t really want to call her that anymore) told me that she raped her ex boyfriend. I didn’t ask or anything. I got to school, met her, and the first thing she said was “I went home to him yesterday and forced him to do it”. \n\nI was under the impression that she had gotten over him, or that she was at least trying to. He was really uncomfortable in the end of their relationship so he broke it off and said he didn’t want any contact with her. During the aftermath of their relationship ending she was constantly crossing boundaries, but she hadn’t done it in a while. So she has a history of doing too much and making people uncomfortable. \n\nAt first I didn’t really know how to react. She said something along the lines of “I’m so stupid” and I agreed with her. Then she started saying things like “Can you just tell me this is a dream” “I mean people who have been abused can turn into the abuser” “I was manic or something it wasn’t really me” etc. and I told her that she’s just trying to make excuses and that she has to face the consequences. Then she started talking about future jobs, so I told her that she was being selfish. \n\nBut I didn’t really say anything else. I honestly don’t know what to say. I’ve always thought that I would stop being friends with someone if something like that was ever revealed, but now I don’t know. \n\nI’m in the same class as her (we graduate this summer) and we are in the same friend group. So I don’t know what i’m supposed to do. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, their genders don’t have anything to do with the situation. I am having a hard time because this was a person I thought I could trust and that I thought could never harm another person in this way. Having a (now former) friend admit to raping someone isn’t exactly easy to process. That is why I needed advice. I would still need advice if it was a guy I was really close to that raped a girl.\n\nEdit2: I got the ex’s snap, i’ll be speaking to him and doing my best to support him in whatever decision he chooses. I am also doing my best to distance myself from the girl. Also something fucked up I learnt today, the girl told her guardian about what she did and her guardian simply said “it’s not that important. just ignore what you did and focus on school”.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Reach out to him to clarify the situation and if it's as bad as it sounds and see if you can talk to law enforcement together.  It'll be an uphill battle if he wants to seek legal action; he's almost certainly not going to be taken seriously so any evidence you can offer will help. END"}
