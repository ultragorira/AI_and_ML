The operator on the phone pretty much told her she had to deliver the baby herself until the ambulance got there.\n\nShe followed everything the operator and delivered my baby boy, when My baby was out he wasn't breathing so she pretty much tore the bathroom apart looking for a nasal aspirator, by the time she got the baby to breathe again, the ems had arrived, where both me and baby were taken to the hospital. Later on when my husband arrived at the hospital the doctor told them if my step daughter hadn't come home when she did, Both me and the baby would have died.\n\nEven after both me and my baby were able to come home, my husband hadn't been able to take off time yet so my step daughter took it upon herself to cancel all plans with her friends, and look after the kids while I rested,cooked dinner and cleaned the house as well.\n\nThat and on top of all that has literally been my rock, In all honesty these 3 weeks I have gotten to know her more than in the 11 years I have been her stepmom.

WTF?  \n\nAs to how exactly she's allowed to travel: she's **not.** This is Illegal and dangerous but it seems i have no say on the matter... my only hope is to avoid getting infected. I need help, what should I do with an infected person on the house?\n\n// Update #1\n\nDue to the amount of advices saying that I should report this, I really feel the need to now. I'm typing this as she's on a plane, on her way here, so avoiding that is no longer possible... \n\nI will contact the local police department, they should be here before she arrives and I'm definitely getting into trouble... But if i think really hard about it, my parents caused this, not me. It's easier that way.\n\n// Update #2\n\nSo... This escalated quickly. I called the non emergency line and told them a family member was coming to the house and they were a carrier of Corona. My city is on a lockdown since the growing cases of the last week so I expected the police to come over stay with us until aunt arrives, and they would tell us what to do. Not so...\n\nPolice arrived, took my parents for interrogation and one of them told me my aunt is being intercepted. Holy, fuck.\n\nI'm alone in my house now, it's night, and looks like they're not gonna be here til tomorrow. I think updates will stop for now but for sure I won't be seeing aunt so soon.

I'm not getting infected by this god awful virus and aunt should be ok in a week, back to her home to pay the debts.

I declined, freaked out and am now leaving. My concern is for my sisters. \n\n\nMy aunt did what she said she was going to do, she barged in with 3 other people, one of them a social worker friend of hers (who was off duty) and my uncle. None of them are allowed at the house so as soon as Scott found out they were there, he called the police.  \n\nBefore the police even showed up, I told my 16 year old sister and the 14 year olds what happened. The 16 year old got angry at her dad. She was walking around the house ranting at her dad and crying. Eventually she decided to come with my aunt and I and then we would firgure out where she could go from then on. However the two 14 year olds did not believe me, they actually started laughing. Then they got angry and told me I was \u201ctrying to destroy\u201d our family and \u201chow could you make up a sick lie\u201d. It got to the point where they threw my and my 16 year sisters stuff out the window. By that time the cops came and told my aunt, uncle and the social worker they had to leave the property. \n\nThe social worker friend let the cops know everything thats been going on. The cops didn\u2019t care, they just cared about the noise and the trespassers. So I, my 16 year old sister, my aunt and uncle and their friend left. Very soon after my grandparents came and got the other three girls, after the 14 year olds called them and came to there senses.\n\nI found out my my grandma that one of the 14 year olds confronted her dad and he didn\u2019t deny anything. In fact he called me a whore and said I should\u2019ve had any problems doing what he asked. That\u2019s when they packed a bag and called my grandparents.My grandparents explained everything separately to the little one. She told my grandpa she prefers him to our dad because grandpa doesn\u2019t yell at her. As much as that pained me, I hope it\u2019s enough to keep the girls at my grandparents for good. \n\nMy 16 year old sister is going to emancipate herself and stay with either our grandparents or our aunt. CPS was called but it was my grandparents this time. I have multiple screen shots on my and my aunts phone of my mother incriminating herself, so we will be able to file charges and hopefully get Scott on the SO registry. That way the girls can stay at their grandparents permanently. \n\nThank you all for the support I appreciate each and every one of your comments, and to the survivors who shared their stories, you are all so strong, thank you.", "completion": "Good job!

{"prompt": "[Update] \n\nYesterday was suppose to be one of the most happiest days of my life and it turned out to be the worst. My fianc\u00e9 never showed up to the ceremony leaving me at the altar. His friends and family tried to get a hold of him but all calls went straight to voice-mail. After waiting an hour for him I told my guests that there wasn't going to be a wedding. I opened the reception hall and told them to enjoy the food and open bar, even if there was no ceremony, I still wanted them to have a good time and enjoy the food and drinks. I tried to call him a couple of times but after 3 more failed calls I just stopped and told everyone else who were trying to get a hold of him to stop. He made it clear he didn't want anyone to get a hold of him and I wasn't going to have them waste their time.\n\n\nI didn't cry, I wasn't going to cry. At least not in front of everyone. His mother came to me and apologized through tears, she told me how disappointed she was in him and that she was so sorry. I just shook my head and stuck with her the entire time. I didn't want her to cry and feel bad for something that wasn't her fault.\n\n\nThe real MVPs were all my friends. They did their absolute best to keep things from being awkward and entertained everyone. They played music, danced and one of them went as far as going back home to bring a projector and a game system for all the kids and teens to play against each other with. I was glad that the day was somewhat saved but I still felt horrible.\u00a0My would-be BIL Ethan kept me from getting shit faced when I really wanted to, told me that it would be awkward if I did so I did my best to keep everyone happy.\n\n\nAfter 11 I told everyone who bought gifts to take them back and get their money back, a few of them refused and had me keep the gifts they got. So now I'm back at the hotel we got and I'm alone. This morning I got a couple of missed calls from my fianc\u00e9 and several messages that I haven't opened yet. I'm so angry at him, he humiliated me yesterday by not showing up when he could've told me he was getting cold feet. I had my friend message him that I want to be left alone and that if he showed up to the hotel room I was going to call my brothers to have him removed. So far he hasn't shown up but I am getting phone calls from his friends probably all wanting me to speak to him. I don't know if it's me being shallow or not but now I'm rethinking our entire relationship and whether or not I see a future with him.\u00a0\n\n\nSo another issue is that I have an extra plane ticket. It was supposed to be for our honeymoon but since the fianc\u00e9 isn't here I decided to enjoy my little getaway vacation for myself. A couple of friends are coming with me but not for another week since they gotta get childcare, put vacation time etc so they can't come since it last second. To be honest I want to invite Ethan because I've never traveled anywhere in my life. I know he's been to where I'm going and I want him to come so he can be there to show us the places to be at. Ethan told me he'd go for me but should I invite him? I asked Ethan's mom and she was all for it but I still don't know if it'll cause drama. Any advice?\u00a0\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nOkay so I feel like I should explain more about Ethan. First I'm not going to take him. Second, I've known Ethan a little longer than my ex-fianc\u00e9.  Please believe me when I say he's a close friend of mine, both of us bonded by teasing his brother and with that we just kinda clicked and became fast friends. I wanted to take him because I didn't know how to use my ticket in the airport. I've never been traveling and I didn't want to look dumb by trying to figure it out. Thankfully, someone said what to do and I'm forever grateful so now I feel much more confident. I know it sounded iffy trying to take Ethan but honestly it was for something innocent. I see him more of a brother then anything now that I look at all the comments you guys left.\n\nAnd finally I read my ex-fiance's messages. Yes, he's alive, he wasn't in any terrible accident and the reason he never showed up was because he found out he has a kid. His childhood sweet heart came by with a kid maybe a couple of weeks ago. His best man knew and never told me because my ex didn't want him to tell me until he was 100% percent sure and I guess he found out today. He apologized so many times for not showing up but he couldn't because he felt so guilty of what? I don't know. He said a large part of him wants to make things right and take care of his son because he's always wanted a family. So screw the last 3 years right? I don't know if that means he's going to go back to his ex because he wants to talk over the phone. Honestly, I'm done. I think it's an excuse to get back with his ex, I don't believe he's ever gotten over her and her over him which is why she chose now to show herself. He sent a picture of the kid to me and I went over ex-fiance's mom's fb to see any pictures she posted of ex-fiance when he was a kid. They're low quality but there is definitely a resemblance. It feels so surreal to me, like this one big joke. I feel like I'm missing more info, like there's something else going on but I'll find out later. I haven't responded so instead I'm just going to open a bottle of wine and just get plastered. My best friend is currently on her way with takeout and ice cream so I thought I'd share this.\n\nMaybe after my much needed vacation I'll do another update but right now I'm just gonna do me. \n\nUntil then, fuck you Ben", "completion": "\n>now I'm rethinking our entire relationship and whether or not I see a future with him\n\nHe literally left you standing at the altar.

This situation has turned dark and I will be making a final update in a few hours before I delete this account.\n\nMy mom and dad divorced when I was 5 years old, and my mom has been completely out of the picture ever since. My dad starting dating my now stepmom when I was 9, they got married right after I turned 10, and she immediately moved in with us.

I always make sure to reset it to factory settings and this keeps the \"new phone\" excitement.

Apparently those stay even when you return to factory settings. One of the videos I found was a video of my dad masturbating. My step mom never goes on business trips or anything, so why he would take a video like this? I decided to confront him.\n\nWhen I did, he looked like he had seen a ghost. He said to delete the video immediately and to never speak of it again. I asked him why he would take a video like this, and he said it's none of my business, and he made me delete the video in front of him(I saved a copy on a flash drive prior), and he said if I ever spoke about to anyone, particularly my step mom, that he was kicking me out and cutting me off completely.\n\nThis infuriated me. He was obviously cheating on my step mom. My dad is at work (he works night shift), so I asked her if I could email her a video I had found and if she could watch it in private (I didn't want to be there when she watched it, and the video was on a flash drive on my laptop). She looked puzzled, but she said sure.\n\nAfterwards, she asked me where I got the video and I told her everything. She said she had never seen the video before, and that she had been suspicious of him having an affair and this confirmed it. She started packing her bags, and she told me she is leaving. My dad doesn't know about any of this yet, but he will be home in a few hours. She's going to confront him then and most likely leave afterwards for good. I'm worried that I made a huge mistake.

{"prompt": "I (M23) have been married to my wife for just over 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter.\n\nFor the past week or two, I've had my suspicions that my wife was talking to someone and/or cheating on me. Last night after I got home, when she was asleep I checked her phone and confirmed my suspicions.\n\nShe has been talking to a co-worker, and the texts from the past two days (previous texts were deleted) ranged from both of them saying \"I love you\" to making plans today for him to come to my house today while I am at work. While they didn't definitively say they were going to have sex, it was STRONGLY implied. There is some evidence of other sexual acts already having taken place.\n\nI am now sitting at a Waffle house after calling in to work to say I'm not coming in. I'm planning on trying to get proof of the visit if he does come over by watching when my alarm is armed/dis-armed (through the app on my phone).\n\nAfter my research, if it ends in divorce, if I can prove she has committed adultry, she will not be eligible for any alimony in my state.\n\nI could stop them from having sex by going home and confronting her before it happens, but it could cost me a lot in the long run if our marriage does fall apart. I love her and don't want it to end, but I can't see how I can forgive her for this. Even if I confronted her now, I would always still feel the same as if she did have sex with him.\n\nThis hurts so much. I love her more than anything, and I feel like there is a hole in my chest, and lead in my stomach. I am physically hungry, but can't bring myself to eat because I am so nauseous. I can't stop shaking, I can't think straight, I feel like a part of me has been ripped out. I am terrified of what this will mean for my life, and more that that, the life of my daughter. I don't know what to do...\n\nUPDATE:\nFirst off thanks for the silver. Too bad my first reddit award had to be for this, but thanks nonetheless.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone for all the advice, suggestions, and support. While I still feel physically sick, I am able to think clearer thanks to everyone. I will keep you all updated as this unfolds.\n\n2nd UPDATE:\nI just want to say thanks... again. I haven't left this  post since I created it, and I've still not stopped reading. This is the only thing keeping me sane right now. If you are just getting here, please don't think because there are 250+ comments that your opinion/advice isn't important. I've read every single comment with an open mind, and I am factoring all of them into what I do.. also it really helps.. a lot.\n\nI have yet to confront them, as the guy hasn't shown up, and I don't think he will... today atleast. Maybe she caught on that I knew. I tried to play it like nothing was wrong this morning when I left, but damn did it hurt. Not sure if she bought it. In their texts, they planned for him to come over Thursday morning (it is currently 12:40pm). If he doesn't show up, I think I'm going to talk to her about it tonight.\n\n3RD UPDATE:\nEvery single one of you are awesome. You're really helping me get through this. The guy never showed up, so here is the current plan: I'm going to act like nothing is wrong for now. After talking to you all, and family, I think I can put on to act like nothing is wrong. I'll go see a lawyer in the morning, and I talked to a PI that I'll probably be hiring. I know from the texts that she planned on having him come over during the hunting trip I have planned for next weekend, so I'm going to make sure I go, and that the PI knows. I think I've decided I'm done. I don't want to try to fix it. I'm going to cover my ass, and get out. It's not just an affair in the sense that she's having sex. She tells him she loves him, and she doesn't seem to love me anymore. I feel like she's trying to use me. She wanted a new car, and for me to pay for her to go to school, but wanted to be with him.\n\nCurrently, she left to (presumably) pick up my daughter from daycare. I'm watching the time. I know how long it should take. If she takes longer, I can guess where she went. Either way, I'm going to try to make it through Christmas, and my daughter's birthday next Friday without saying anything about this. Hopefully the PI can find evidence then. Wish me luck.\n\nUPDATE 4; GET READY, THIS IS A BIG ONE:\nSo I came home, and acted normal. Everything seemed normal. We joked a bit, and fuck if that doesn't hurt when you're heartbroken, and had dinner. Sitting on the couch after dinner she asks me to pause the TV, and asks when I was gonna mention \"it\". I asked what \"it\" was, and she said she knew I saw the texts. Start the conversation.\n\nShe tells me that he didn't come over (which I obviously knew) and that she told him she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. She blocked his number. Obviously since she has done this the original plan is off the table.\n\nI still love her. My heart is broken, I dont know if I can ever forgive her or trust her; I don't know if I can be in a relationship with her. She want's to work on us. I don't know if I am willing to or not.\n\nShe says she was talking to him because she didn't feel wanted. She didn't feel a deep emotional connection between us and he \"knew all the right things to say.\" She said she told him she couldn't be with him and told him multiple times she was done with him, yet here she is inviting him to our house. She said it wasn't a choice what she felt for him. The exact story was along the lines of \"He was bagging at my register one day, and I accidentally touched his hand, and it was like electricity.\" I know you're probably reading this, and thinking it's a load of BS... Yeah me too. How am I supposed to trust her? I can't see her side of this.\n\nShould I give her a chance? Should I try to work on things? I don't know. Do I want to? Is it worth it? I have to figure all this out. I told her I can't decide now. I have to think about it.\n\nI'm thinking about asking some co-workers (no family in town, perks of being in the Military) if I can crash on their couch for a few days. Get away from it all and think. Of course I'd come back for Christmas for my daughters sake.\n\nI don't see any point in hiring the PI now, as I genuinely don't think she'd so anything for a while. Maybe I'm wrong. Obviously I have been before. I'm taking plenty of precautions in the mean time to make sure I know what she is doing, and if anything is questionable, I'm done. Of course I won't tell her about any of this.\n\nThis will be my last update for today. Please continue to offer your perspective and advice, but I think this is largely a decision I'll have to make after due consideration.\n\nUPDATE 5; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, MY FEELINGS, AND THE PLAN:\nI'm going to do a little Q&A section for the most asked questions.\n\nQ: How did she find out I know?\nA: Two ways. She had a strong suspicion that I knew because when she woke up, there was a notification on her phone for a new screenshot, but when she clicked it, there was no file. She was 100% sure I knew once she found this post. Yup she's seen it, she's probably reading this now. Hi wife. We'll get more into that later.\n\nQ: What did she say when I asked if she had sex with him?\nA: She said no. I am inclined to believe her, because many of the texts, including some the last ones, he was saying how excited he was to \"finally see how hot [her] pussy is\" <---that's a direct quote from him from the texts btw. No does this mean I believe that she didn't? No. Not at all. It doesn't change how I feel whether she did or not. She planned on it, and probably would've if I hadn't found out. It'll be a long time before we ever are intimate again, if we ever are\n I will definitely have us both checked for STDs.\n\nQ: How do I know she won't do it again?\nA: Obviously I don't. If we try to fix things, I'll probably never be able to fully trust her again. She is going to have to prove that she will be 100% honest with me. Here's the first test: To my wife-If you are reading this, text me NOW; text me right now and tell me. Stop reading and text me. I will know if you have read it and don't tell me. It will be over.\n\nSome info on the comments I've seen:\nI'd say roughly 80-90% of you are telling me to lawyer up and leave her. Of that 80-90%, around 20% is actually making any kind of argument as to why I should rather just saying \"Once a cheater, always a cheater.\" or something similar.\nThe other 10-20% are telling me to either give it a shot, or to do what I want/what makes me happy. The majority of those posters are making good arguments as to why I should stay.\nThank you to everyone that has commented. It means so much to me that some many internet strangers have taken the time to try and help or comfort me.\nAlso, please don't downvote people because you don't agree with their opinion. Everyone's opinion matters, even if it doesn't align with yours.\n\nI feel like in update 4, I represented her wrongly. She was saying that she did what she did with him because she felt unwanted, but she understood that it was her fault. She knows she should have talked to me. She knows she is the one in the wrong. She says she doesn't blame me for it. I didn't push her away and make her do this. She said she could control how she felt for him (which I still have a hard time believing), but she could've controlled what she did. She let him talk her into it because I think that even if she doesn't realize it, it's what she wanted at the time.\n\nOur marriage hasn't been perfect. We've had issues. We've had issues communicating, especially lately. We've not had a great sex life. I felt like she didn't care enough, and she felt like I didn't care enough. Neither of us tried enough to work on it. Does that mean I blame myself for this? Fuck no. Not even a little. She did this, and she knows that's how I feel.\n\nI'm not trying to make you guys like her, I just want you to understand that I don't think, and never did think, that she is a whore that is a terrible person. She is a terrible wife for what she did to me, but in general is not a bad person.\n\nNow, for the plan going forward:\nI thought long and hard (ha) last night and this morning about what I wanted. What would make ME happy. I'm not going to make the decision to stay or leave based on what she wants. I'm not going to decide to stay to keep out family together. I have to make it based on what I want. I want to stay with her... but that doesn't mean I've decided to. I want us to work things out and talk to counselors and our marriage be better than ever, but I have no idea if that will happen.\n\nAfter I knew she read this post, I knew that she knew about the SC law on adultery, and that she wouldn't be entitled to alimony if she was caught. That was my only defense. Now that she knows, I don't think she'd do anything with anyone for a long time, which means that hiring a PI now or when I go hunting next weekend would be useless, however if she's reading this and knew I wasn't hiring one, she could think she could get away with it. I'm putting some safeguards in place to ensure that doesn't happen, or if it does I have proof.\n\nI came up with an idea. I knew I couldn't and wouldn't trust her for a long time if ever again if we tried to fix things. I figured out the only thing that can even start to make me believe that MAYBE she actually wants to stay with me for me and work on our relationship, and not stay with me for what I can do for her. I asked her if she would sign a postnuptial agreement. I'll have to talk to a lawyer still, but if she will agree to sign a contract that if we divorce, even at no-fault, she gets nothing. No alimony, no possessions except certain outlined things that are undeniably hers (her computer, her clothes, her jewelry, etc.), and no child support. (Let me clarify this because I've gotten a couple of comments about it; I wouldn't not support my daughter and I wouldn't keep my daughter from her, I'd just like to avoid court ordered child support, and give her x amount to support my daughter based on how long she has her at any given time, rather than x amount per month). I don't know how it would work, hence why I have to talk to a lawyer and make sure I can do it like that. \n\nI have further plans, but I will not be posting them here as she may see this, and those plans involve her not knowing about them. I may reveal them later on, but it will be long from now.\n\nAt this point, if the postnuptial agreement works how I hope, and she signs it, I think I'd be willing to TRY to work on things. I know a lot of you aren't going to like this. Maybe she is lying to me. Maybe she really is just a piece of shit... but I knew her before she did this. I knew her before our marriage degraded. I don't think she did it because she wanted to have sex with someone else. I don't think she did it because she doesn't love me. I think she did it because he was telling her the exact same things I used to when we were first together. I think she misses what we used to be, and while we will never be what we used to be, this will go one of theee ways. Either we try to work on things, it doesn't work out, and we get a divorce. We try to work on things, she continues to cheat, and we get a divorce. Or, we try to work on things, we fix problems we have had with ourselves and our marriage since we first got together, and our marriage and relationship will be stronger than it has ever been. I'm hoping for the latter.\n\nI love you guys. You are awesome. The amount of support I've gotten has been overwhelming. I'm still reading every (top-level) comment, and message I get. Shout out to the fella that gave me my first gold, and a huge shout out to the champ that gave me my first platinum. Please, continue to let me know what you think. I know a lot of you won't be happy with my decision, or will be disappointed in me, but I've gotta do this for me.\n\nQuick add on to my latest update:\nShe has TERRIBLE self image issues. She thinks the worst of herself. She's also super introverted and doesn't get to know many people. This is the first job she's had where she's been around other people in years. Of course this doesn't excuse anything, but I felt like it was relevant.\n\nP.S. Next update will probably be after next week. \n\nUPDATE 6:\nHey guys. Sorry I've made you wait for an update.  Currently sitting at the bar, drinking some Jack & coke.\n\nSo we talked. We tried to work things out, and it seemed like it was getting better. Then she said that she wasn't sure how she felt or if she wanted to try. We talked so more and she said she did want to try. We had a session of counseling with a therapist Wednesday.\n\nThe counseling went more or less like this. She said she felt like she wasn't getting enough out of the marriage, and that I didn't care or talk to her. The therapist asked her some questions and she answered basically saying she could tell I did care and did talk to her (or try to anyway). The therapist kinda explained to her that it wasn't that I didn't care (by her own admission), and instead that she just wasn't happy with it and didn't know what she wanted. Well, she decided what she wanted.\n\nLast night she started setting up an air mattress in the extra room, and I saw she had some new sheets that she had ordered to fit it. I looked at her phone to see when she had ordered them, and she was texting him again.\n\nSo obviously, we're done. We will be getting a divorce. I know a lot of you are going to say \"I told you so\", but I was 100% aware this was a possibility when I tried to work things out, and I don't regret it at all. I will look back on this in the future and know I did everything I could to fix things. I have nothing left to regret, and that makes me happy. I tried, and I can never blame myself now.\n\nNow, before anyone says it, please refrain from calling her a bitch, or just generally talking shit about my wife. As you cant just stop loving at will, I still love her. Telling me how shitty a person she is doesn't help.\n\nI don't forgive her, and I may never, but i don't resent her. I still want the best for her and out daughter and want her to be happy. I genuinely believe she regrets hurting me, but (at least believes that) can't help how she feels. We are done, but she is currently planning to move back to Florida with her family, which means leaving this guy too.\n\nShe doesn't think she can be happy with me anymore, but I don't really think she's leaving me to be with him. In my opinion, she is excited about the pursuit. The \"puppy dog\" love that you get when you meet someone new. I think she is damaged, and needs help to figure out herself, and her self-deprecation issues.\n\nShe will be staying here in our house for the time being, and seeing a therapist (hopefully) while she still gets the benefit of it being married to me. By SC law, we will have to live apart for a year before we can file for the divorce, but she will be leaving relatively soon.\n\nWe have agreed to do mediation instead of having lawyers involved to save us money and fighting. We still get along well enough. She has agreed that she will not pursue alimony, and I think she will be giving me full custody of our daughter if the courts accept it, but with her still getting as much visitation as possible. \n\nI won't try to fuck her over, as much as you guys will tell me too, and although I love you all for all the support and everything you have done for me, you don't know me, and you don't know her. She's not a terrible person. I truly believe she is telling me the truth and won't try to fuck me over either.\n\nIt's gonna be rough for a long time, but we'll make it through this. The most important thing to me right now is making sure our daughter is taken care of, and that we do what is best for her.\n\nI'm on drink #4 now, and getting tired of typing, so I'm done for now, but if I left out any details (and I'm sure I did) feel free to ask, and I will reply to any questions, as well as updating the update to include the details I left out.\n\nI appreciate you all more than you can know, and I wish I could afford to give each and every one of you medals, but unfortunately I can't. If anyone is in the Columbia, SC area, I'd love a drinking buddy (now or later). I'm buying... unless like 40 people try to come. Have a great day. Thanks for reading. Thanks for everything. You're amazing.\n\n\nUpdate part 4 years later: All is said and done, and while I know this was a wild ride, it ended happily for me and my daughter. I posted an update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/109q3fc/update_my_wife_is_cheating_help_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

{"prompt": "An update post to my \u201cI think my son is gay\u201d\n\nA few days ago, I made a post titled \u201cI think my son is gay\u201d, I said that I wanted to get some time off work so that I could talk to him and hopefully get him to come out.\n\nHere is a link to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/afp5jv/i_think_my_son_is_gay/?st=JR0QSZ28&sh=ad7bd9c9\n\nI was overwhelmed with lots of helpful advice and now I would like to share with the ones that are interested, how it went!\n\nSo in my original post I said how I wanted to get time off work to spend time with him but sadly I could not do this and instead I got permission from the post office if I can bring my son along on one of my deliveries which they said yes too. I talked to my son on Tuesday and asked if he would be interested in spending some time with me the next day and perhaps come to work with me. I said he could miss a day of school to spend time together. He was happy to spend time with me and he also didn\u2019t seem to mind waking up early to come.\n\nSo yesterday came and we are both waking at around 6:30am we both get washed, have our breakfast and we get ready. We jump in the post van and we head to the post office. I noticed I had a bigger delivery than usual which was good because it meant I had more time to be with my son.\n\nWe begin driving and start our conversations small I ask how he has been doing at school and things like that (my son is 16). What I didn\u2019t mention in my first post is that my son isn\u2019t my biological son, his real dad left when he was 12 and his mother (my wife) died in 2011.\n\nEventually we came by a very convenient charity which was to help prevent violence against gay youths. I pulled over so that we could go check it out, I believed that if he saw me donating money and talking about how gay people should be able to be accepted it will help him think I\u2019m open to gay people. I donated \u00a310 and we got back in the post van and this is when he says \u201cTim, what made you do that?\u201d I explained that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that gays are seen as different people and said that if my son was gay I would accept him and treat him no different. He went quiet and about 30 minutes later he says \u201cTim, I have something to tell you, I\u2019m gay\u201d.\n\nI just stopped the van and began to hug him telling him that I\u2019m proud that he has cane out and told him that he is very brave. We both did some crying and we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this has been a long post but I\u2019m proud of my boy and I wanted to share this with you kind people that helped me. Thank you all!\n\nTL;DR took my son to work with me, donated to a charity to help stop violence against gays, son came out as gay, we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald\u2019s\n\n\nEdit: WHAT THE FRICK!!! So many people replied my goodness I showed my son he was so happy honestly it made his day thank you all so much, I\u2019m speechless, how can you amazing people exist, I won\u2019t question it because it\u2019s been truly amazing honestly can\u2019t express this enough THANK YOU ALL!!!", "completion": "What a ridiculously unbelievable story\n\nI mean come on\n\nDo you REALLY expect us to believe that McDonald's ice cream machine actually WORKED?

{"prompt": "English is not my native language so please bare with me to be honest, I just join here to ask monetary assistance on a assistance group here. I am a Muslim girl, just turned 18 and I ran away from our home because my parents is forcing me to marry a guy a lot older than me, I guess he is around 45-50 years old. My parents is asking me to marry him cause my brother saw us in not a good situation and misinterpreted it, he was actually sexually  assaulting me. It is really important on our religion to stay pure until marriage and it is humiliating for them to saw me on that position. I try explaining them what actually happened but they are not listening and just forcing me to marry a disgusting old man. I run away home I just can't accept that I will marry a devil and it hurts me deeply that my family is not believing me.  I ran away home and currently staying at a friend but I can't be here forever. I ran out of money and still trying to look for a job, I cannoy reach out to any relatives because they will notify my parents  I will need to ask assistance to a group here on Reddit but it is not allowing me, asking me for a karma. I don't what that is and really don't know where to get them. I want to run away from my city as far as I can, but I need help from strangers, it is humiliating to ask for assistance there but that's my only way, I tried gofundme as Twitter suggests but it is not available on our country. Please please help me gain karma or tell me what karma on Reddit means. I want to get out of here as early as possible so that my parents will not catch me or if there is any other group that provides assistance without any karma. Thank you so in advance. \n\n\n\nPs.

Just to add, I'm from the Philippines. I'm really scared to disclose this, I actually tried asking help on twitter and when I told them I'm a Filipina I was bombarded with a lot of guys trying to buy explicit pictures, because according to them, Philippines is land of cheap woman, but we are not.

I just really need 400 karma, just for me to be able to post on r/assistance but you give me a lot and I couldn't be more thankful and also to the badges and awards, I really don't know what that means and how to use it but still, thank you, I know that it is special here on Reddit.

I have found a shelter, and they advised me to keep the name on private, a fellow Filipino helped reached them thank you but we are still gathering funds for my transport money. They allow me to stay there and also allowed to hide my religion, I'm sorry but I don't want to practice Islam anymore, I still know that there is God but practicing it's rules is not for me.

{"prompt": "EDIT1: my sister (who should be a private eye honestly) managed to find his grandparents and their phone number so his grandmother is currently on her way. Thanks to everyone who offered their advice. This is the first time anything like this has happened and I was more concerned with protecting the kid than worrying about the legality of doing so, so thank you for reminding me to do things correctly  \n\n\nEDIT2: I just woke up to an inbox of very mixed feelings from people who think I did the right thing, wrong thing, dumb thing, etc. and I'm sure there will be a similar mix regardless of what I say but here's more details I didn't mention before I went to sleep.\n\n* I live in a predominately black neighborhood in a southern state. I just moved here less than two months ago and haven't seen many police but, from previous experiences, the cops aren't my first choice of who to call.\n* The little boy was also black and reminded me of one of my nephews. I'm 26 and my 18yr nephew (it's my sister's home) was also here with me so I didn't even think of anybody potentially thinking we were doing something to the kid. When I was his age I frequently hung out with the older kid (like 10yrs older) next door and his friends (they never bullied me or made me feel like I was annoying) so as soon as I saw him that's what I was reminded of.\n* As soon as I sat him down on the couch and turned some cartoons on, I went into the other room and facetimed my older sister who lives there but was out of town. She said he was the kid from next door and that she had his uncle's number (who also lives there) and was going to try and call him first because the boy said he wanted either his uncle, or he wanted to go to his older brother's (14) house.\n* His older brother is a half brother from what it seems, and lives with his biological father and his paternal grandparents (so no relation to his mom). The kid told me he doesn't know his real father. \n* He said he didn't have any phone numbers for anyone besides his mom but he knew the name of the street that his older brother lived on, and the names of that kid's grandparents. I told my sister all of this and within like 10mins she had found one of the grandparents and spoke to them on the phone.\n* I have heard horror stories about CPS, the foster care system, and police so forgive me for not immediately choosing those options. Especially as a black man. From my perspective those were not the safest option for the kid.\n* In terms of bruises, he said he had none. He also said it was the first time she'd ever done that but that she threatens to a lot.\n* He said the reason he got in trouble was because his mom thought he had called one of his teachers \"the B-word\" through his virtual learning thing. He said it wasn't him and that someone else must have signed in with his account and typed it. I don't know if I believe the whole story but I thought if he had planned his escape out like this and actually executed then it really must've been that bad of a beating.\n* I asked him if he felt safe at home and his reply was \"I don't feel safe for my little brother\"\n* Since I live next door I'm gonna make sure to keep an eye on him and his little brother and invite them over (I have other nieces and nephews nearby that are his age) even just to make sure his mom knows somebody else is aware of them and is watching/listening.\n* Oh, and the reason why I thought calling the cops would benefit me more than the child is because it would absolve me from anything like kidnapping, harboring, or child endangerment etc. but would most likely result in one of the cops staying with him talking with him while the other goes to the house and explains what's happening. That would inevitably lead to the kid going right back to that house.\n* The only other element I can think of is that I won't say I fully believe that it is an abusive home because I know of a lot of black moms that spank their kids pretty hard sometimes but still love them to death. It's not always out of hate, sometimes it's because they haven't been taught a better option. So I'm not 100% convinced but I'll definitely make sure they know we've got both kid's backs.\n* Also, in the potential situation where it's not an abusive home but maybe a little too heavy handed/frequent with the corporal punishment, that genuinely could be a better situation than foster care. Which is all kinds of messed up but a definite possibility.   \n\n\n&#x200B;", "completion": "Tell CPS about it... The grandma may send the child back to the abusive home...

I saw some people saying that he could\u2019ve mistaken my sister\u2019s trainer bra for a sports bra, I don\u2019t see how that makes it any less inappropriate. Also my sister\u2019s trainer bra is like 3 times smaller than my bras. But anyways I told my mom that I found my underwear under my brothers bed, I didn\u2019t tell her about her and my sister\u2019s bras. She decided to wait for my dad to get back from work, so we waited until he got home. Once he did my mom told him about my underwear and they both went to my brother\u2019s room to talk to him. My dad was calm but my mom was really mad. She demanded to see the box so my brother showed them the stuff. I could tell my mom was in disbelief. My mom saw my crusty thong and my little sister\u2019s trainer bra and started screaming at him. In my 16 years that I\u2019ve known my dad, I\u2019ve only ever seen him cry once (when my little sister was born) but he was crying now. I left the room to go with my sister while my mom still yelled at my brother. It\u2019s been almost an hour since this happened and my parents haven\u2019t said anything to me. I\u2019m in my room with my sister watching a movie right now.

Not with his twisted trophies being crusted with a full layer of his special frosting. It's clearly not a one-off deal, a spur of the moment brainfart.\n\nHe had a collection of undergarment with the whole female side of the family represented... If he wanted a bra or some panties, he'd have easily purchased a cheap set somewhere and nobody'd have known.\n\nAlso, while you can sort of kind of make up some excuse for the actual \"sexy stuff\", there's no way around the creepiness about the training bra... Unless OP's sister is a lot \"ahead of the curve\", a 9yo training bra barely qualifies as a bra at all, so the fact he pleasured himself, a lot, to that is very very very disturbing.\n\nWe've all been young, horny and likely frustrated. Many might have wanked to some questionable material once or twice, but having your own stash of stained stolen underwear belonging to your mom and sisters (one of which isn't even in the double-digits) is not \"oh, I found a swimsuit catalogue\" or \"I didn't mean to look up midget granny porn\".\n\nThe guy needs help.

I havent told her how i feel yet.\n\nBefore she was \"officially\" my girlfriend she asked me if i would date someone like Belle Delphine, and I said no, because that would make me insecure about the relationship and because exclusivity is important to me and she still decided to accept to be my girlfriend.\n\nShe also said that it's okay for her to do it, since she wouldnt mind if I did it.

It seems like she already knew you weren\u2019t the type of person to be okay with it, but it also seems like you\u2019re the type of person who knew that she would consider it? So the question is which one of you will budge when it comes to deciding what will happen. I don\u2019t think either one of you should necessarily give up your position for the sake of the other person, I think you guys should sit down and have a real conversation about if there was a possibility to make this work for both of you and keep the relationship comfortable and open in terms of communication throughout it. You should also ask her what her motivation behind this is, financially, emotionally, for fun? It varies with a lot of different women what they want to get out of setting up a business like this. And don\u2019t lie to yourself, if it\u2019s not something you\u2019re comfortable with don\u2019t let those feelings fester and cause tension in a relationship that otherwise may not have any other issues.

I never thought Reddit would be this helpful. \n\n***ORIGINAL POST***\n\nI've been with my fiancee for 4 years. I'm 30 and she's 39. She has a 16 year old daughter. \n\nThey moved in with me after we've been together for about 6 months. I never really got involved with the parenting of her daughter. It wasn't my place and I never had kids so I don't have any experience especially with teenagers. \n\nTwo years ago I caught her daughter with another girl when I came home from work. She begged me not to tell her mom so I didn't. It's not my place to discuss her sexuality. \n\nYesterday her daughter came home from school with a girl and came out to her mom. She flew into this rage and started cussing and calling her daughter names. And then she kicked her out and told her not to come back till she's \"normal\".\n\nMy fiancee is very Christian. So to her being gay is a sin. I tried to reason with her but she doesn't care. She doesn't want to see her daughter again. \n\nHer daughter went to stay with her girlfriend and her parents. I've been in contact with her and told her I'd try to persuade her mom to let her back in. But I don't see that happening. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm honestly disgusted with the way she reacted. I don't want her daughter to be homeless. She's a good kid and our relationship has been pretty good. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated. And I apologize for any grammar errors English isn't my first language.", "completion": "This is a great time to tell your fianc\u00e9e to get out of your house and your life, because you want nothing to do with a homophobic bully who is emotionally abusing her own daughter.\n\nThe money you were thinking of putting toward finding this appalling woman a place - put it toward finding housing for the kid instead. Support the victim, not the abuser. The kid is the one who needs your help. Your ex is a grown adult asshole who can figure out how to put a roof over her head by herself. If she thinks kicking someone out on no notice is okay enough that it can be done to a child, she\u2019s very clearly saying it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do to her too.\n\nOh, and make clear to the kid that she is welcome to come back any time, either to get her stuff or to stay, and it\u2019s her mother who will be leaving if she has a problem.\n\nFor the future, don\u2019t date fundamentalists with obnoxious, bigoted beliefs. This can\u2019t be the first you heard of her believing this. When you get involved with people whose fundamental beliefs are judgemental, cruel and incoherent you are setting yourself up for this problem."}

I just finished my education when we started dating and I have been doing all sorts of jobs since. Sometimes two at a time. I did this to expand my resume and gather job experience.\n\nI worked in caf\u00e9s, bookstores, a library, a grocery store and as an English tutor. Most of those jobs lasted about 3 to 5 months. My shortest stay was 2 and a half weeks, my longest 8 months, but since I didn't have a hard time applying for new positions, I tried to block it out, though it was kind of eating me up internally.\n\nPeople called to complain about me, people left bad reviews about me, people used my employee wifi access to look up sketchy things on the internet under my name, former 'employees' called to 'inform' them about me, right name and all, and much much more subtle stuff that I couldn't disprove. But I was too anxious to do anything about it. I just told my girlfriend, she comforted me, she supported me every time I got my life ruined by these people. But I kept going, though they kept finding me.\n\nFast forward to this week. I currently hold a part-time position at a bakery, I've been working there for two months and a half. It's going okay, but my manager approached me about something regarding our google reviews.\n\nSomeone was complaining about an employee, and their description of them could only really fit me. It was on a day where we're pretty short of staff, so I could've been the only person in the store on that day for all I know. Anyway, their review contained some pretty elaborate and nasty comments about me. This has happened on one or two of my jobs already.\n\nI told my manager that it was all pretty bogus and that someone had a vendetta against me, as it has happened before. She believed me, and told me that she'll dismiss the comment. On my break, I checked out the review myself. Their username was kinda stupid, I'm not gonna type it out here since I still work there, but I'll just call them \"Mick Myrtle\" as it was in the same range of sounds-kinda-fake-but-not-really. Anyway, I come home but don't tell Janice about it. She has heard it all before, so I didn't see the point in complaining about another time I almost lost my position.\n\nWe chat, all is well, and she leaves the room. Her phone is on the table, and suddenly, she get's a notification or an email of some sort from google. I don't remember what it said exactly, but the popup read something along the lines of \"Mick Myrtle: 'Manager' has responded to your Review!\"\n\nMy heart dropped. I've been trying to ignore it since. this was two days ago. It just fit in the picture of bad reviews. It fit in the picture of the phoned complains my workplaces have received about me in the past. It fits in the picture of all the sketchy things I've been fired for.\n\nWhy would she do that, though? I'm looking for an explanation. This literally can't be. She's the only thing keeping me sane. I don't know what to do.", "completion": "This is extreme manipulation and abuse!

First of all, thank you. I can't say that enough. \n\nThanks to so many of you who commented different organizations who could help my daughter and I, we are now safe. \n\nI got in touch with a few organizations and one of them was able to get my daughter and I on a plane on Christmas Eve. I left our things, with the exception of whatever we could fit in two suitcases and left without saying a word. We arrived that night and some amazing people from the organization were there to pick us up and take us to housing. \n\nWe can stay here for up to 18 months, but I totally plan on getting on my feet before then. They have childcare, connections to lawyers, psychologists... Everything we need. They had an apartment ready for us, with a Christmas tree and everything. They had presents for my daughter to open on Christmas morning and even a couple for me as well. \n\nWe have now been here for 6 nights and for the first time since my daughter was born, I have had a full nights rest. I have talked to a lawyer who is helping me get an order of protection so that if we were ever found, I know I will be protected by the law. \n\nI feel like I can do anything. I can go to school, I can get whatever job I want, I can spend time with my daughter without being in fear. This is such a blessing. I feel like I can live my life. \n\nFor the past 2 1/2 years, I have been stuck in the mindset that to protect my daughter and myself, I couldn't act young. It was work and home every. single. day. Getting to separate myself from my terrible situation made me realize that I can be a responsible mother for my daughter and be 20 years old. I get to enjoy being a young a parent. It doesn't have to be so scary. \n\nSo once again, thank you to everyone who helped. I wish I could hug every single one of you in person.

She's called me every single day for as long as I can remember. Once I got a cellphone at 13, she and I spoke multiple times per day and saw each other frequently. I'm 28 now and she just turned 70 on the 12th. \n\nMy aunt's work facility was infected with covid-19. It was in another building so she was very lax about everything. She lives in a duplex with my Gramma with my Gramma living above her. She didn't use any precautions. She went to the store often, she would go up and visit my grandma even though my Gramma begged her to stay downstairs until the pandemic was over. My dad even gave them both n95 masks which my aunt never used. My Gramma is a heavy lady, she's got diabetes and her breathing was already not great. \n\nMy Gramma was admitted to the hospital last week and she spent her birthday in the ICU. She died twice last night and they did CPR and used a defibrillator to bring her back. Now she's on a ventilator and things aren't looking good. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I haven't actually seen my grandma since Christmas due to me working over time and then in March we went into lockdown and I didn't want to risk getting her sick. \n\nMy aunt has been crying nonstop and feels horrible and wants me to call her but I have her number blocked.

{"prompt": "I, 28f, am currently 19 weeks pregnant. My partner, 29M, and I are very excited, as this is our first baby and we have been trying for a few months.\n\nWe announced the pregnancy a month ago at a dinner party we hosted, and everyone seemed surprised and overjoyed. My sister, 35f, who I will call K, immediately burst into tears and asked me how I could do this to her. I stared at her, and asked \u201cWhat?\u201d She started ranting, saying that I always got everything I wanted (which is not true, I worked hard for all that I have) and that she knew I got pregnant just so I could rub her infertility in her face.\n\nShe screamed at me for 5 minutes about how I didn\u2019t deserve to be a mother and she should be the one pregnant right now. My parents left with her soon after, and the party was basically over. I was really disturbed by my sister's reaction, because we had been pretty close before, and she had never done anything like this.\n\nK called me the next day, apologizing for how she acted at my announcement and asked if we could meet up for coffee. I accepted. We met up and she pretended as nothing had happened. Then she started a big speech about her infertility, how heartbreaking it is to be growing life inside of her, just to lose it, and how she had always wanted children of her own. She then proceeded to ask me if I could consider getting an abortion, to make things \u201cfair\u201d, or letting her adopt my baby. I stared at her and asked if she was serious. K said she was. I just dropped my part of the bill on the table and left.\n\nL texted me a rant that night about how I\u2019d made K cry, and how all they wanted was to be parents, and that this meant so much to them, and I \u201cowed\u201d them for being more successful than them. I and my partner invested many years into our jobs, and we have worked very hard to earn what we earn now. I told them that my partner and I had been hoping for kids too and that I was not giving up my baby. He hung up.\n\nShe later sent me a long letter (4 pages) about how she had always wanted to be a mother, and could I consider either abortion or letting her adopt my baby, how I should care about my older sister's happiness, how she would make a better mum, how the oldest kid should have the first grandchild, and how I could always just have another baby since it was \"so easy for me to conceive\".\n\nAfter that, she quieted down some, and I thought we were done with this. Except... it wasn't. She had posted MY SONOGRAM on her FB, and captioned it \u201cL and I are expecting! We can\u2019t wait to meet our little princess!\u201d\n\nI was seeing red. I texted her and demanded she takes the post down. No reply.\\`\\` I texted L. No reply. So I called my mother and told her what happened. She was able to make K take the post down, luckily enough. K has called me petty for calling my mum and has continued to demand I give up my baby. I sent her a letter explaining that I had had enough of her nonsense, I AM keeping my baby, and that I recommend she get some help. I added that if she continues, I will not hesitate to call 999.\n\nThis weekend, however, was the absolute last straw. My mum and dad have the spare key to my house, and while she was over at their house for brunch, she took the key. While my partner and I were at work, she broke into our house and stole all the clothing, blankets, nappies, bottles, and pretty much any other item we had bought for the baby, except furniture. It was later returned after my mum found it in her car. I called 999, but they told me I couldn't do anything because I had no proof and because it was all returned.\n\nMy partner and I are moving in April, but I'm still scared my sister will find out where we live and take my child. I get that she's upset and jealous, due to her infertility, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up my baby. My parents know about this, and they have been doing their best to get her some help. She doesn't want to adopt, because she wants a child that's her own flesh and blood. I'm due in August, and the stress she's causing cannot and will not be good for me or the baby. My partner is looking into a cease-and-desist letter. Is there anything else I should do or say? I'm scared for my baby.\n\n**UPDATE 28-3-22**\n\nThe support I've received from this website is overwhelming! Thank you all for your comments, although I couldn't reply to all of them, they are appreciated! We have had the locks changed, cameras installed, and a Ring doorbell. I've started saving every letter and screenshotting every message my sister has sent and plan to take them to court for a restraining order very soon. We have also been seriously documenting everything.\n\nMy husband and I are planning a trip to Ireland for our anniversary next week, and it's going to be good to clear our heads from my sister. I've called 999 to report her for harassment, and they gave her a warning. She's contacted me saying that if I won't give her my child, I can at least pay for multiple rounds of IVF, which I have not replied to other than refusing. She's been begging my parents to convince me to give up my baby, which they refuse to do. They have also been given a statement that basically says that if they give her my contact information, they will not see my baby, to which they have agreed.\n\nI've since changed my phone number, and we are moving very soon. My sister does not know our new address. She actually stood on our stoop for 20 minutes a few days ago, banging on our door, and yelling. My husband opened a window and told her that if she didn't leave, he would let the dog out, and threatened to call the police. We have a rather small, but hyper puppy who jumps on everyone and barks a lot, and she is quite scared of dogs, actually, so this made her leave. I started working from home last week, as did my husband, and we've followed the advice of one of the comments, washed all of the baby stuff, as well as made sure none of the food in our kitchen was messed with (none was, luckily).\n\nWe're planning on getting a restraining order as soon as possible, and are looking forward to our trip! I'm already sick of being pregnant, and I'm not even in the third trimester. I just want my baby. Thank you all again for your wonderful advice, and I may update you again when the baby is born.", "completion": "You should block her number, get a restraining order, move far, far away, and never speak to her again."}

I dont want to die, but i dont want to live this life. I am not depressed or anxious or whatever, im good in the head, but recent events have taken their toll on me.\n\nForgot to mention thje important details, i am 19, just finished my first semester in Computer Science in university (and probably my last semester) and i do not work. I live in Lebanon. I do not have a passport to another country. I do not have anyone that can support me. I am completely alone and have a bit of money(1-2k ish) left if i sell my car and all i own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess the advice im asking for here is what should i do? Is there any hope? also please note i live in Lebanon; basically shit internet, shit electricity, no social benifits or whatever no nothing. This country is worse than a 3rd world. i probably miswed a lot of important details, but im struggling to think straight. Feel free to ask me anything (doesnt matter if its personal) related to the matter. Thank you for reading my reddit post. have a good day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I cannot begin to explain how i feel. I never thought anyone would care this much. I am not good with expressing myself but thank you to each and everyone who replied. It really is helping way more than you think. This is going to be a ramble but here goes. As to everyone asking me not to give up, i hope i dont. i want to figure this out and be on top i really do. i will try my best. i hope on day in the future i can come back and update you guys with a happy ending. i havent cried in a long time and you guys have brought emotions i thought were long gone. so thank you for that. I am trying to reply to every single reply but so many are coming in so fast, so for those that i miss, i am very sorry. Eventually i will get to it and i thank you in advance. So for those who are interested, i have concluded from all the replies a general plan that i would like to share for some criticism. First thing i should do is find a job, which i am trying my best to do. After i find a job i will try and find the cheapest/best rent i can and live on the bare minimum while saving up as much as i can. Now here is where i get a little lost. i know i should get a certain amount of money before considering immigration but have no idea what estimate that consist of, so help on that would be amazing. Next i will contact embassies (Canada and Sweden have been good suggestions so far) for help regarding immigration or a student visa. Also any help regarding immigration would be amazing as i have no clue how all that works. now that im typing that i feel like im asking for too much. i really dont deserve the support you guys have given me today, i cant thank you enough. Anyways that is the general plan, and i know for a fact once i land in a country better than Lebanon i will thrive. i know i can. All i need is a half decent government behind me that wont steal my money. thats it. i dont want rights, i dont want jack shit. i just want my hard earned money. So yeah this is probably the worst paragraph of words to read, so for those of you who did, thank you. My brain is barely functioning i feel like now, so this took a lot of energy to type. Thank you yet again to each and every single one of you. i mean it. I hope to update you guys soon on what happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: I think i have finally replied to every single comment i got. If i get more replies during the night i will answer them tomorrow. I wanted to say thank you again everyone for everything you did. Also to everyone asking to donate, please go donate that money to a charity of your choice. I will be going to bed now, and i wanted to emphasize how much this all means to me. You guys changed me today. Thank you again. i cannot say that enough. I hope one day i will be posting an update with a happy ending. Thank you for your best wishes and hope to talk to you again soon reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Hello everyone, i just woke up and got a shower and hopped on the computer. I am still in shock with everyone's support. i still cant thank you enough. I am reading through all the comments but i am afraid i do not have enough time to reply to all of them. I just want you guys to know i am reading your comments and i appreciate it way more than you think. Today is a big day for me; will be roaming around looking for jobs, need to setup some emergency foods and such. Lots to do today. Your support is giving me strength beyond what i thought i had. You guys have proven that people still care, there is hope. I will be updating you whenever i can, as i now consider you guys my friends. Also dont forget im reading your replies, and i really really appreciate it very much. Regarding looking for online jobs, i will try to make up a decent resume of sorts when i get back home and see what i can find. I really shouldn't be asking for more help from you guys, as you have done way more than enough, but i thought id ask ; i still have a few bucks remaining in my paypal, nothing worth cashing out though i was wondering if maybe like i can invest it or gamble it or of the sorts. Im obviously not counting on it, neither am i a gambler, just trying to give an example. Just a thing i can try my luck in see if it can help. Again, thank you to each and everyone one of you. i keep repeating myself but as i keep saying, im bad at expressing myself. I just want you guys to know i really appreciate everything. Will update you soon, have a good day everyone.", "completion": "i read your entire post and i just want to let you know that i\u2019m here for you if you need to talk. i sadly don\u2019t know much about lebanon. but in your country right now is it possible for you to find a decent job? even if it\u2019s being a server or some beginner level job? if you have a car you could live there until you collect enough money to rent. \nif you want to move,Canada (where i live) is very open to immigration, it might be hard right now with COVID but you could look into it. if your grades are good you could even apply for a student visa and apply for a uni here. \nBut immigrating still costs a lot of money so you would need to work a bit to collect enough money to pay for the application and everything in between. \ncan i ask how you got to this situation?"}
{"prompt": "Didn\u2019t know where to post this. Sorry if it\u2019s the wrong place. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a way. \n\nAt uni years ago, I lived in a big house share at the top of the house. One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. \n\nShe had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. \n\nI was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. \n\nI never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. \n\nIf a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can\u2019t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to feel about this and i think that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing. If I am over blowing feeling this way and I should just man up then please tell me. I just want to not feel such resentment as it\u2019s bringing me down. But I don\u2019t know how to.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: i really only expected a few replies, so this has overwhelmed me. I haven\u2019t been able to thank everyone but I really appreciate all the replies. The funny thing is, this thread has been cathartic and almost helped to give me some kind of closure in a way which I never expected. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply.", "completion": "You sound like you're being pretty clear-headed about this. It doesn't sound out of proportion. \n\nWhat she did was absolutely wrong.

Just please don't let it eat you alive; don't let her have that kind of control over your life. I'm not sure if this is healthy, but for me, telling myself that he wins if I let that experience own me helped a lot (thanks, snarky best friend - she knew what to say, lol). \n\n(There's a chance that she's realized she messed up and actually changed her behaviour, but I'm inclined the think that she hasn't. I'm cynical, and I think the kind of person who could casually do something that serious and never apologize is likely to continue behaving badly.)"}
{"prompt": "I have been preparing to defend my cruiser weight belt against a young man from Pakistan. I found him to be a very likeable individual and struck up a friendship with him. He revealed to me that he was a closeted gay (which there are still some taboos about in boxing given the fact it is a blood sport and aids). Although, I have little knowledge of the LGBT community, I felt honoured that he trusted me enough to share this. \n\nI then did something rather foolish, I sent him an arrogant text telling him that \u201cif you can take my crown, you would make a great ambassador for our sport.\u201d\n\nA couple of days later he came out openly as gay to his family and community on Facebook.

It's terrible that that happened and I'm very sorry, but you had NOTHING to do with it.\n\nFirst of all, your text didn't even reference his sexuality in any way. It was just a nice, friendly text in a competitive spirit. So I seriously doubt that text had anything to do with his decision, nor that he really thought about that one single text all that much.\n\nSecond of all, it was his choice to come out as gay. And there's nothing wrong with that choice. The fault lies with the people who hurt him; not with him, and not with you. Even if you HAD somehow inspired him to come out openly, that only means that he felt safe & comfortable talking with you about it. Which is a good thing. It was not wrong of you to make him feel that way.\n\nThird of all, you can't be responsible for a murderer. Whoever did this horrific act, is insane. That's not within your control. Nor could you have ever possibly foreseen something like this happening. So don't blame yourself."}

To my friends mom i am seen as a threat to her, her daughter, and her boyfriend for absolutely no reason.\n\nEdit: I informed my mom about the whole situation (she was formally friends with my friends mom) and she told me that she has a multitude of mental problems and even accused my mother of being the reason her first husband left her.

{"prompt": "This is a whole cluster fuck so strap in. Also going to post on a legal sub.\n\nI (17f) was browsing tumblr one day when I came across this blog with a familiar face as the pfp- it was a girl from my school. She was 2 years below me and I didn't know her name, but we took the same bus and she was in some of the same classes as my brother. He was also friends with her cousin.\n\nAt first I looked because I was curious but after a few posts, I realised this was a Ted Bundy stan account. I was very disturbed- most of it was cringy flower crown edits, but there was the occasional text post where she would say disgusting things about the victims and say she wish she knew a serial killer, etc, etc.\n\nAt one point, I found a picture of bloody wrists and the caption led me to believe it was her. I ss every post and her pfp and anything that proved it was her and contacted our school. My hope was that they would intercept and talk to her and the parents about her online behaviour and get her help.  I did it all anonymously and was told that she had been spoken to and action was being taken. That was the last I heard of it for around 5 months. I did check her account regularly because I was genuinely worried, but nothing else was posted other than a simple text post saying 'goodbye friends'. I thought that was the end of it until a month ago. I found out from my brother that she had committed suicide.\n\nI was devastated. I never really knew this girl yet I felt like I had lost someone. My brother (because he was in her year and had a connection to her) was getting updates as they happened from her cousin.

{"prompt": "I'm in complete mental turmoil.\n\nLong story short, I once had a nice, roughly 7 person very close friend group, one of us had a girlfriend and after they broke up she slept with me one night while we were both drunk at an afterparty (I apologized to the friend profusely for sleeping with his ex and we are on good terms now). Now she's moved on and is dating another one of my close friends, so yeah, she gets around the friend group quite well. Around a year ago, I noticed my friend (with the gf) start to get very distant from me, almost in a mean way. After a while I asked him why, he said his girlfriend didn't want him to talk to me (Understandable on both their parts, I am the guy that slept with his gf, and she likely didn't wanna see her one-night-stand too often) I took his word for it and moved on, okay.\n\nI later start noticing many, many people in our more distant friend group/ network start blocking me on socials or being straight up awful to me if I reached out to them. I found out that she had told people that I had R\\*ped her. Naturally I was very confused as I had NOT, and we'd actually been somewhat decent friends after we'd slept together (taken classes together and went to a few more parties and whatnot). I tried to reach out to her but she had blocked me, as had all of her close friends so getting through to her would be very hard. Her friends started attacking my friends (who had been there that night and know that nothing bad went down) and it tore my friend group apart.\n\nFast forward a year, and that original friendgroup is down to 3 (i'm fearing 2 soon enough) all my closer friends know I did nothing wrong but seemingly left as the drama was too much to deal with, and I understand that. The word seemingly keeps spreading and there seems to be no end in sight to the amount of harassments and hate i'll be getting, I have no idea what to do and I fear that things will only get worse from here as I slowly get ostracized from everything I had been a part of.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEdit: I've read through the whole thread, and will continue to do so as comments come in, thank you all for your help in trying to navigate this awful situation.\n\nEdit 2: With the exception of the friend with the gf everyone that knows both of us and both sides of the story believes me, my behavior and personality isn't consistent with this accusation, and hers is", "completion": "Seems like this is solved but, I would just walk away.

Yes, this has happened more than once.\n\nI work a full time job to ensure my daughter and I have a place to live and because I have no help from family, my daughter goes to daycare. The daycare is fully aware of the active restraining order and have a photo of him on file.

{"prompt": "Okay, i'm using a throwaway because this whole thing is really starting to freak me out. I live in a small town in Florida. It's pretty small, and because of that i'm close to a small handful of my neighbors. Down the road there is this family that lives there, a mom and two daughters.\n\nI went over there the other day to see how they were doing, since it had been a couple days and I was feeling a little bored. The mother, Mary, was there, but I didn't see the girls. I asked where they were and she just looked kind of confused. She said Alex was in her room, as she was being really moody lately.\n\nBut when I asked about her younger daughter, Sandy, she just looked confused, and maybe worried? She said she only had the one.\n\nI haven't gotten a good chance to talk to her eldest daughter, so I don't know if it's just the mom, but I asked a few of my other neighbors, and they just looked really confused, like I was spouting nonsense.\n\nIt's really starting to freak me out. I can't find anything online about this kind of thing happening, I don't think. Her name is Sandy Beckett.\n\nWhat should I do? I know i'm certain she exists, i've talked to her so many times. She was a really sweet kid, and everyone just forgot her and she's nowhere to be found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/Update: Woah, I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. Thank you to everyone who is concerned about my mental state, but unless I see anything else that might be a sign of some kind of illness or break such as schizophrenia, i'm going to hold off on going to a psychiatrist. I don't want to be committed against my will if i'm not crazy, and something is actually happening here.\n\nI'm getting alot of the same questions so I thought i'd clear a few things up, and give some more details about the situation.\n\nFirst of all, I'm absolutely sure that Sandy and Alex are two different people. Alot of you are saying that they're both short for Alexandra, and I might just be remembering wrong. I've seen them in the same room together, and interacting. (I think Sandy is short for Sandra anyway.)\n\nI'm also certain they're sisters, not cousins or friends or anything of that nature. When I first met the family, Mary introduced them as her daughters, and everything i've seen points to them being sisters.\n\nA few of you have questioned if I've seen Sandy age over the years, and I have. She's gotten older. She even got a haircut once, when she grew tired of her long hair.\n\nI should also probably give some more specifics about all of us. I'm 17, have lived here for quite some time, and don't really know much of a history of mental illness in my family. I don't know most of my family, so there might be, but beyond a bit of depression on my Dad's side, nothing big that I know of. As for drugs, beyond a little weed I took in the freshmen year of highschool, I'm not on anything like that.\n\nI don't know exact ages for the girls, but Alex is maybe 6 or 7, while Sandy was around 4. As for how often I see them, it varies. With the pandemic, I've seen them significantly less, but before all this I saw them roughly once a week. Sometimes I'd go a while without seeing them, and other times i'd see them just about every day. It evens out.\n\nSome other things I've seen in the comments include the carbon monoxide levels in my house. I'm not sure about how to check that but i'll definitely look into getting that checked out.\n\nIf anyone has any other questions please feel free to ask me. I wanted to make this a follow up post, but i'm not exactly tech savvy, so this will have to do. Later today, i'm going to head over to their house again. I'm just gonna hang out with Mary, like i've done in the past, and at some point i'll say I need to use the bathroom, and then I'll check the hall for Sandy's bedroom. I'll let you know how that goes later today. Until then, thanks so much for all your concern, but for now I just need to figure out what's going on.\n\n**Edit/Update 2**: Okay, So as promised I went over to their house today. I didn't bring up Sandy again, and Mary seemed to either pretend the previous conversation didn't happen, or doesn't remember it. She didn't seem concerned for me or my mental health at all, which is good.\n\nAfter a while of general talking about stuff; some shows we like, covid, etc, I got up to use the bathroom. Mary didn't think anything of it, so I slipped down the hall. Before going to the bathroom, I looked down the hall. The kids bedrooms are still there. I tried to open Sandy's room, but it was locked. I didn't want to be caught snooping, so I quickly went to the bathroom and after a few minutes came back out.\n\nI still haven't seen Alex. I asked Mary where she was, and she said she went down to see a few of the kids a few streets over. I didn't say anything, but that's a really weird answer, for a couple reasons. It's a small town, but the boys she was talking about are a good 20 minute walk. I honestly cant imagine Alex walking down there by herself, and her bike was still on their front lawn.\n\nAny photos on their walls that I remember having the family are now gone. Not edited or anything, fully removed. A few were replaced with photos of Alex, and one was replaced with a painting of a cat, seemingly done by Alex.\n\nI'm really starting to get worried here, as any good explanation is gone, and even though Alex still seemingly exists, I haven't seen her in a while.\n\nAlso, I tried to call the school district to get any information about a Sandy Beckett, but they wouldn't give me anything, since I wasn't a parent/guardian and wasn't on any lists of contacts. Not sure what to do now besides be vigilant and try and talk to Alex. Thanks for all your support, guys, it's really helping out. I'll try to respond to more comments, and hopefully give you guys a better picture of what's going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mini Update/Edit:** I'm seeing alot of comments asking about my parents. Without going into too much of my problems, my mother is dead and my father is god knows where. I live with my grandparents. And as much as I want to say that they'll be able to help me out, I honestly have never known more checked-out people in my life. I could tell them I'm doing meth (im not lol) and they'd just be like \"have fun\". They don't care much for anything around them. They don't talk to the neighbors, and I know for a fact that they don't talk to the Becketts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nupdate?: someones outside. i've never seen em before theyre just standing in the middle of the road im freaking out. nobody new comes down here especially not at 11 at night. i cant go out i dont want em to see me.

I'm going to be completely honest here, I don't really remember writing the last update, or the post I made to r/Drugs. I'm not sure what all has happened these past few days here, but I do know that at some point I ended up getting sick. Something is wrong with my stomach, and I haven't been in the best physical or mental state. I realized I should probably update, so people don't get worried.\n\nIn all honesty, i'm just really tired and want all of this to stop. I'm scared about Sandy, and I don't know what all is happening anymore. I havent seen Mary or Alex since the last time I went over there. This isn't exactly a satisfying update, but i'm really tired and hurting all the time, and am frankly getting really tired with being worried about Sandy. Unless i find something I think is proof of something one way or another, whether im losing a few screws, or something did happen to Sandy. I just want to stop and go back to how things used to be. I'm sorry, guys.\n\nIf anything interesting happens i'll be sure to update. when I get better, i'm going to make an effort to go find Alex, but until then, I need to focus on shaking whatever bug I managed to pick up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini Update (not just health, I actually do have something relevant):\n\nI'm mostly better now, still a little iffy, but with a bit more time, i'll probably be good as new and ready to keep lookin into this.\n\nAs for Sandy, I took some of you guys's advice and went on socials to see if I could find anything about Sandy. I'm not going to give out socials (obviously) because I don't want them getting harrassed, especially if all this shit is just in my head.\n\nHonestly, I didn't look too hard, but I plan to. So far, theres been nothing of interest. Mary hasn't posted too much on her Facebook as of late, though with the pandemic, its not like theres much to talk about besides politics. I found a picture of Alex up from a few weeks ago, and it looks new, so I'm confident she's okay. Nothing of Sandy. I'm gonna keep looking, as this seems like a good angle. Only problem is theres a lot of posts to sift through to try and find anything about Sandy.\n\nI'm nervous though about if I find a picture of her. Should I post it? I feel kinda weird combing through her Facebook looking for pictures of a kid, even more so posting it to reddit. Idk I'm just really tired and need to figure this whole thing out. I'm gonna try to respond to some more people on here, but there's alot of comments, some saying the same thing, so I can't get them all. Thanks for all the support guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate/confession: People found a blog. I don't know what else I expected from Reddit, but they found it, and I need to come clean. Not in the way you think, but I have been somewhat lying. \n\nOP does not exist. There was no neighbor. No grandparents, nothing. The reason things seem sketchy, is because I tried to do something sketchy.\n\nI've seen those compilation videos of \"mysteries solved by the internet\" and similar titles. I thought if I tried to go about this like it was a current thing, maybe I could finally get some damn closure. I'm not a 17 year old concerned neighbor. My name is Alex Beckett. \n\nIn 2014 my younger sister Sandy Beckett went missing. I lived in Bronson, Florida. I tried to contact the police, but they didn't care about what some random kid had to say, especially considering I had been driven by my older cousin Jr. He has been arrested at least three times, once for hunting on private property, some bullshit charge about being a public nuisance or something (he was kinda being a prick, but thats what you get from a conspiracy nut) and for something related to the possession of crack, even though I know for a fact he couldn't have had any. \n\nSo the police weren't exactly inclined to care about me telling them Sandy went missing when I showed up in a beaten up Ford truck with the local conspiracy nut who's known for crack despite only doin weed. They basically told me the equivalent of \"Go home, honey, and leave the mysteries for your little games.\" \n\nMy mother wouldn't be much help either. She's not exactly what society, or any sober person for that matter, would call a good mother. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if she fucking killed Sandy and panicked and somehow got it to stay quiet. \n\nI think what worked against me back then was my age, my family, and the fact that my mom never wanted us kids to go out much. Not many people really knew us, despite being pretty tight knit. \n\nSo as for why I did this, I just wanted some answers. I thought maybe the internet could help me. And before anybody asks why I lied about who I am, would you really have believed me if I had some crazy conspiracy that happened when I was so young? I know it wouldv'e been chalked up to some false memory bullshit. Thats not what happened. You don't forget a sister. I've forgotten alot of things, but damnit I'm not gonna forget Sandy. \n\nSo I made this more episodic, I guess. Trying to get people interested, so they'd maybe look into this, and help me find answers. only problem is that this is the internet, and nobody takes these kinds of things as real. I've gotten a million comments that this isn't real. Well, bingo, you're half right. I just wanted people to see this, and maybe find some of those crazy internet sleuths to finally find Sandy. I don't even know if she's alive, but I hope she is. \n\nPlease. I know I haven't been truthful, and i'm sorry. I just wanted to find my sister. I did some dumb things, but I need some closure. \n\nAll in all, I'm sorry for any upset I may cause, and I'm sorry I lied. I hope that some people will still try and help me. I'll give any information I can to help. ", "completion": "OP I see a lot of people (who I assume are joking) saying things like \"you're next\", and I just want you to be careful.

I thought maybe he was just tired. He went in the bathroom and stayed there for a long time making no sound. I asked if he was ok and he mumbled something. Me and my mom were watching the news and he walks out of the bathroom asking what happened in that weak voice again. I asked him \"Is there something wrong with you?\" and he said yes. When I asked him what's wrong, he responded I don't know. Me and mom kept asking \"What's wrong, why are you acting like that? Is something hurting? Did something happen?\" And each time he kept responding \"I don't know.\" My mom asked him how could he not know what's wrong and he bursted out crying \"I don't know!\" I sat by him on the couch and he wouldn't open his eyes. When I asked him if he was in pain he cried saying \"I don't know\" again. Then he went back to his room to sleep. Does anyone know what could be wrong with him? \n\nUPDATE: I called 911 and EMS came and did some tests on my dad. They said he seems to be healthy but should go to the hospital to make sure. He refused. Guess there isn't anything else I can do. Thankfully he doesn't seem to be having a stroke. He's walking and talking normally now. He said he took about 6 sleeping pills and a powerful muscle relaxer so I guess that could be it. Both my parents are really pissed at me for calling 911 but hey better to be safe than sorry! Thanks for all the responses. \n\nCLARIFICATION: I'm getting a lot of comments asking the same questions. My dad has severe insomnia that sometimes causes him to be up for several days. Even the strongest sleeping pills often don't help him. He was prescribed the sleeping pills and muscle relaxer. He didn't take them all at once but over the course of a day. I know my dad isn't suicidal or a drug abuser (except for this instance obviously). Ironically, he's very against any kind of drugs, including prescription, and I often have to force him to take his pills. He probably just had impaired judgement from sleep deprivation. Obviously still very stupid behavior I'll make sure never happens again. People keep saying that he could've had TIA and needs to go to the ER immediately, but since he refuses to go I don't think there's anything I can do. I'll no longer be hesitant to call 911 if something like this ever happens again, but beyond that my hands are tied. I'll be on the lookout for symptoms of a stroke, Alzheimer's, low blood sugar, or any strange behavior from him. Thankfully he's acting completely normal now.

My family kept me going through it all. I live in Southern California and was attending school not far reach from my family. However, two months ago.. there was a horrible break-in while I was away (Police said).

I confronted her and told her, my hours were two hours more than what she had added up on the time card.

He did not tell me he was doing this beforehand, apparently only his best friend since they were little(BF for short) knew this was happening. I was a bit shocked, but after some thought it made sense and I apologized for not recognizing his internal struggle sooner. \n&ensp;He was excited that everyone of his friends seemed to accept it, as well as family members, and I was happy to see him happier than I ever had before. He mentioned hormone therapy and surgery and how excited/nervous he was. It wasn't until about three days ago that anyone asked me how I felt as his partner, and I didn't say anything because I didn't want to take away from what I felt was his moment. I knew the conversation had to be had sooner than later. \n&ensp;I took Ex aside and said that I loved him and would be there for him, but if he went through with GR surgery it would be best to break up now. He was understandably upset and I didn't know how else to put it other than \"I'm not attracted to men.\" He seemed to understand, but after I got off work I was met with dozens of messages from BF and a few of mine and his friends calling me a transphobe and doing this when he needed support.

He only learned the full scope of what was going on last night because he had been ignoring messages while a couple of friends (who were not involved in the harrassing) spent the day cheering him up. He made them all apologize but a couple of his friends and BF added that they still don't like what I did, and I understand because I hurt their friend even if I meant well.

We met other people and I ended up finding someone who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I never told her about me and my sister for obvious reasons. But now I'm feeling super guilty about not telling her. She trusts me with her life and tells me everything, and I have this huge thing weighing me down. I was also her first time, and I lied to her saying it was also mine cus I've never \"officially\" dated anyone before her.\n\nI'm terrified if I tell her, she'll be disgusted and leave me.

That's where my dad likes to spend his evenings watching TV.\n\nWell, now that my mum isn't home, he's spending his evenings masturbating in the living room and I can see it from the staircase (I don't know if he knows I can see it, but the fact that he only does this when my mum isn't home is suspicious to me). Even when I go downstairs to get a glass of water, and I stomp really loudly on the stairs, he keeps masturbating.\n\nWhat is worse is that he is verbally/emotionally abusive and he has threatened physical violence against us before. Because of this, seeing him act openly sexual when I'm home alone with him is making me really scared.\n\nI'm scared my mum is gonna downplay it like she does with all of his abuse but it makes me sick to my stomach and afraid. I try to stomp around a lot to remind him that I'm home so maybe he'll stop touching himself but he still does it. Worse still, sometimes I can hear him moaning even with my door closed.

{"prompt": "18 year old high school senior here. This has been bothering me ever since I realized high school will be over in just a little over a semester.\n\nThroughout high school, I've just been an average kid (on the surface). B student, doing the bare minimum expected of me, etc. Nothing astounding or terrible and I'm just trying to get through high school.\n\nWhen I turned 16, I started working part time for my aunt at her restaurant just as a way to get some spending money for gas and going to high school football games with friends. She didn't pay me conventionally. I have a PayPal through which she would pay me. I was under 18 at the time so the account is in my mom's name, but she doesn't have the password nor any real reason (or so she thinks at least, she's probably forgotten about the account entirely at this point) to monitor it. Also, the account has my email and phone number. Point is, she has no access to the account. (This is probably relevant because it's what I used to acquire my money in the second half of this post.)\n\nI made enough money for gas and the occasional ball game, but not much more than that. When I wanted to upgrade my computer, I began thinking of ways to make some extra cash. My aunt refused to give me a raise and my mom wouldn't let me look for a new job because she didn't want me to \"abandon my aunt\" for another business, why don't you just stop spending your money elsewhere, etc.\n\nDrawing has always been a hobby and a passion of mine. I've been drawing since I was 9 or 10 and I'd say I'm pretty decent at it. So naturally, while brainstorming side-job ideas, I thought of starting an art commission business.\n\nFor the first few months, business wasn't booming. I had told all of my friends and family about it and posted it on my private social media. A few of my relatives commissioned art from me, but in hindsight it was almost certainly out of pity for my lack of business or maybe my mom told them to.\n\nI eventually began posting about my art commissions on public media such as Instagram, Reddit (the account is long gone by now, don't ask.), and...the place where I struck gold...4chan.\n\nThe drought kept up for another month until someone replied to me on a /b/ art thread claiming to be interested in a commission. We exchanged Kiks and started talking. When he told me what he wanted me to draw, I found it repulsive and came up with an excuse, saying I don't have experience drawing what he wanted and thanking him for the offer. That was when he offered double the amount of money I initially asked for, offering me a whole 40 bucks.\n\n$40 isn't a lot, but as I was younger, it was about equal to a day at work. So on the one hand, $40. On the other, I did not want to nor did I have any experience in drawing furry porn.\n\nTo summarize the next few days, much to my surprise, the guy liked my work and said his friends did too. He invited me to a Discord server full of people like him, and from there I joined other servers and forums and message boards dedicated to \"that kind of art.\" From then on, the commissions started rolling in, first slowly, then steadily. Once both demand and my skill in drawing that kind of art increased, I started buffing up my prices.\n\nLet me tell you. those sick bastards will pay a lot. a LOT. for those commissions. No shit, the highest commission I ever charged was for $350, and the dude paid it in full. The average price of a commission was around \\~$75-100, with the price increasing for more demanding artwork, technically demanding or mentally demanding. (I didn't tell them about the mentally demanding part, I had to keep up a reputation by pretending to be one of them. Easily the worst part of the job.)\n\nYou may be wondering, why did I continue doing this after I got enough money for that computer upgrade? Well, I was 16-18 and making more money than my previous self could've ever imagined making. Of course I continued the commissions. Besides, after drawing your 50th naked anthropomorphic \"fursona\" (these guys' furry alter egos), you start to get pretty desensitized towards it.\n\nAfter drawing your 150th, or your 200th, however, starts to become a little dehumanizing and mid-life crisis (early-life crisis?) inducing. I finally made the revelation earlier this year that I just can't do this forever. Not only would it probably not be a very secure job forever, but it made me progressively more disgusted by myself.\n\nAaaanyway, in the past few years, I've managed to rack up just under $22,000 in furry art commissions. I'm ready to forget about my past, go to art school, study graphic design, and make a living as an artist in a legitimate way rather than a repugnant way.\n\nMy parents aren't rich, but they are just a little on the wealthy side. They and I have discussed the expenses of college in the past and they have told me that if I were to continue living at home, attend a certain art school which is relatively close to home (and is relatively inexpensive), and get as much financial aide and scholarships as I could, they would be able to cover most of the expenses, but I would probably need a loan of $25,000-30,000 to cover the rest. Assuming I can get accepted into the college (which I think I easily can), with my savings and their savings, and a little bit of being economic, I believe I would be able to attend all 4 years without having to get a loan at all. My main idea was to tell them I won the lottery, but...I don't know. I hate lying and I've been hiding this from them for years. I feel like i just need to come clean with them about it. I have absolutely no idea how they would react.\n\nAll that to ask this. What is the best way to go about this? Should I go through with lying to them? What would be the most believable way to lie to them while keeping their trust and support?\n\nTL;DR: Made bank drawing furry porn in high school. Parents don't know about the money but I want to use it for college. What do?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Currently, my favorite idea is the middle ground of telling them about how I got the money from my commissions while also not going into the detail of my art. I would play it off as if it was a surprise and that's why I didn't tell them earlier. Another idea I like is investing it and getting a loan. Maybe I'll do one or both of these, or perhaps neither. I haven't fully decided yet.\n\nTo those who wish to see my art (furry or otherwise), and to those who say they wish to commission art from me, I'm going to have to regretfully decline your request. I've said too much here, to show my art or give my contact information for a commission would possibly be too identifying. For the same reason, I don't want to reveal the servers or forums I was formerly active on. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just want to be careful. Sorry about that. If you're looking to get into the furry art industry, 4chan art request threads may be your gateway if you're persistent and eventually get lucky.\n\nEDIT 2: Don't worry guys, I will talk to an accountant and pay my taxes. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. That will be my first priority once I talk to my parents.", "completion": "Tell your parents that it\u2019s from selling your art, but don\u2019t mention the furries. Draw some regular pictures in case they want to see examples of what you drew."}

{"prompt": "\nEdit: I Survived an ATTEMPTED Kidnapping... \n\nI need some advice. When I was in middle school, I worked for my dad\u2019s law office every summer as a receptionist/runner. He would take me to work with him every day and I would work a full day with him. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. One of my jobs was as a runner. Back in the 80\u2019s, there was no email and fax machines were brand new and not every office had them. I had to run errands to banks, other offices, etc. On one of these errands, a nice looking, well-dressed man came up to me and asked me the time. I told him and kept walking. I noticed he was behind me as I walked but at a safe distance.  As I continued on my way, I felt uneasy but thought I was overreacting, especially when I crossed the street and noticed he did not follow. At that point I relaxed and continued on with my errands.\n\nOn the way back to the office, I noticed he was at the spot where I had left him. He was standing with his back to me pretending to look into a shop window. As I walked by, I noticed he started following me again so I picked up my pace. As we got to the corner where I would make the turn to go to my dad\u2019s office, he came up behind me, & picked me up from behind (I was very small...about 5 feet and less than 100 lbs). With one hand he opened the back passenger side door. With the other hand he held me up under my arms and around my neck and tried to put me feet first in the car. I screamed and yelled. There were people just a few feet away at a bus stop. They were just staring then looking away. I realized they weren\u2019t going to help so I put my feet on the door frame and locked my knees and started clawing behind me at his eyes, hair, anything I could grab while screaming my head off. At some point, he dropped me to the ground and ran to the drivers door and sped off. I remember every detail like it was yesterday. His face, his suit, his car. \n\nI got up ran into the office building, up the elevator, into my dad\u2019s conference room full of people and told him what happened. He ran out the office. After that I don\u2019t have much information. We never discussed it again. He told me he \u201ctook care of it.\u201d   I never spoke to police. My mom never asked me about it. \n\nAs an adult, I started telling this to occasional friends and my husband. They were horrified. Apparently this wasn\u2019t normal. So I asked my dad questions. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I asked if he reported it to police. He said he did but that he told them he would not allow them to question me. He didn\u2019t want me to relive it or traumatize me. He didn\u2019t want me on the news. He was afraid I would become the man\u2019s obsession or something. This was the 80\u2019s when parents were terrified of their kids being on milk cartons. \n\nFast forward over 30 years...I\u2019m obsessed with crime shows, unsolved mysteries, etc. I have spoken to therapists about this event, some friends & family so I have people who I have told the details over the years. I\u2019m watching a show and BAM there is his face. The show never mentions when or where his crimes took place. I Google and they happened when I was in middle school. He lived less than 5 miles from where my attempted kidnapping was. My best friend works for the police department in that city now. She found a detective who was on the force at the time and remembered the case. He confirmed the kind of car he had. \n\nHe is serving multiple life sentences for kidnapping, raping, holding captive young girls and murdering one. My question, should I write to him in prison?\n\nFor so many years, people have doubted my story. My dad passed away 6 years ago. They don\u2019t believe the police would have not gotten involved. When this man was arrested, it was national news. i am sure it must have been plastered all over our local news stations and newspapers. I believe my dad hid it from me because he knew from my description he was my attacker. What would you do? \n\nMy friend, the one in law enforcement says there is no reason to reach out to him because he will just enjoy the chance to be relevant in my life and I will not be able to believe a word he says.

{"prompt": "So my friend had a little girl named Mariana. She doesn\u2019t know who the father is, and whatever. High key she\u2019s always been kind of a shit mom - neglectful and short tempered. But I always thought she loved Mariana\n\nI babysat for Mariana a bit here and there but I wasn\u2019t the only sitter. I came to really like this kid. \n\nShe\u2019s now 4. \n\nEver since January my friend was bragging about her new boyfriend in Atlanta. Late April she messaged me and said \u201chey, my sitter bailed, can you watch Mary (our nickname for Mariana) from friday to Monday (April 27-30)? I\u2019m going to Atlanta to meet my boyfriend and I can\u2019t bring her.\u201d \n\nI agreed to babysit. She told the school and everything. \n\nSo Friday morning she dropped off a bunch of clothes and a stuffy at my apartment. In hindsight she left way more clothes than was normal, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Then she left to catch her plane. \n\nI went and picked up Mariana from school, and took her home (for the record I don\u2019t work, I receive compensation and disability from a work injury that left me with a bad knee). I took her to the park across the street from my building and played with her until dinner time, we cooked dinner together, we cleaned up, watched a movie, and then I read her stories (on my phone, the mother didn\u2019t have books and never read to her). I got her changed and put her to bed on the couch, and I went to sleep. We had a good weekend, we went to the library Saturday for half the day and played at the park, and Sunday was kind of a lazy cuddle day - we did some crafts, put on a movie, and napped all day. \n\nMonday after school the mom was supposed to have come to gotten Mariana by 5. She didn\u2019t show. I spammed her phone with calls and texts and got no answer. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do so I just kept doing what I was doing. Tuesday, there was still no contact. Mariana was starting to get upset and asked where mommy was. \n\nWednesday I went to my friend\u2019s house but no one home. I contacted all of our mutual friends but still nothing. \n\nWednesday night was hard. Mariana had a really bad tantrum, crying and screaming for her mommy. It was so bad she didn\u2019t sleep and I had to tell her school she wouldn\u2019t be in. The school, for the record, wasn\u2019t asking questions yet. \n\nFinally I got her to calm down. I told her her mommy got a lil lost on her trip but until she came home I\u2019d take care of her. \n\nShe started to have nightmares about being abandoned and became anxious and clingy. After a week of being woken up by her screaming through the night, I let her sleep with me, which helped tremendously. \n\nSo that lasted 5 days until I bought her a little futon and put it beside my bed, so if she wakes up she can see that I\u2019m still right beside her. \n\nWhen she was delivered to me in April, her clothes smelled iffy, her shoes had holes in the soles and were too small, and I found out she needs glasses. I bought her a whole new wardrobe, new shoes, I taught her how to cook and bake and we\u2019re learning guitar for kids. \n\nShe\u2019s healthier, she looks better (before she looked tired all the time and seemed to just be... not well nourished). She hadn\u2019t touched any soda since she\u2019s been in my care and she eats regular healthy meals.\n\nBut we ran into an issue. I took her to get glasses, and the eye doctor said I couldn\u2019t sign for her or make appointments for her since I wasn\u2019t her legal guardian. The school began asking \u201cwhere is your friend?\u201d And I have no idea. \n\nI told my mom that I would be going to the police and asking them what to do, but what she told me made me stop.... now it\u2019s been 2 weeks and I know I can\u2019t just keep her but... my mom told me if I went to the police I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her. They\u2019d take her away and try to find the mom or give her to another relative of hers - Mariana would likely go to my friend\u2019s mom who used to beat her. \n\nWhen I was getting ready to go with Mariana to the police station I burst into tears and I hugged her and I told her I loved her and she said \u201cI wuv you too daddy\u201d without any prompting or that word ever being said around her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to lose her... out of everyone in her life I\u2019m the only one who wanted her. I love her. I want her. \n\nEdit: just to clarify, Mariana\u2019s grandmother and uncle both know I have her. They seem to know where the mother is but they won\u2019t say anything. They don\u2019t care that I\u2019m taking care of her and they have never requested or demanded her. They don\u2019t want her.\n\nWhat do I do? Can I be allowed to adopt her based on the grounds that I\u2019ve been looking after her this long? Or will they take her away? \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve decided that I have to do the right thing. I\u2019m going to call the grandmother Monday morning and tell her I want custody. And then no matter what, I\u2019ll call CPS, and apply for emergency custody. I\u2019m not ready to say goodbye. I\u2019m on the brink of a panic attack just thinking of it, I feel sick and I\u2019m sweating. But.... we have laws for a reason, and if I circumvent them to protect Mariana other people can do it to hurt kids. \n\nI\u2019m going to wait until Monday. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to give Mariana the best night of her life. Anything she wants to do or wants to have is hers. \n\nWish me luck.\n\nEdit 3: I sought out help from r/legaladvice but I don\u2019t think they understand what I\u2019m trying to figure out since almost all of their comments are about race. But yeah, I will reach out to CPS and explain that I have spent months trying to get in touch with Mariana\u2019s legal guardian, that I have been her surrogate parent since April, and that Mariana had benefited from my care. I\u2019ll try to explain that I would like to be granted temporary custody until this is figured out since separating us could be traumatizing for Mariana. Thank you all for your advice and kind comments. \n\nEdit 4: since it seemed to upset a lot of people I deleted some information about how no one knows Mariana\u2019s cultural identity. It\u2019s not really relevant anyways as my concerns that culture could influence CPS\u2019s decisions is apparently unfounded. I\u2019m happy that CPS doesn\u2019t see colour or culture but I hope that in doing so, they don\u2019t mistakenly put children in the homes of people who are disrespectful towards their heritage. \n\nEdit 5: I just got off the phone with Mariana\u2019s grandmother. It didn\u2019t go well. She was quite offended when I said I had already called CPS, and she was even more offended that I want to adopt Mariana. She insinuated that I am trying to hurt the mother because I\u2019m jealous that she won\u2019t sleep with me. While Mariana\u2019s mother is a pretty woman, our personalities are at conflict and despite my crippling loneliness I am not interested in engaging in those activities with her. The exchange became heated as she focused on my weight and lack of sexual prowess and I focused on Mariana\u2019s wellbeing and my desire to give her a good home. \n\nI\u2019ll make a new update post once everything has settled down. CPS should have someone here by 4:30. \n\nEdit 6: I can\u2019t really message 200 people so I\u2019ll just post this here and whoever sees it sees it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8uljpa/in_april_a_friend_dropped_her_daughter_off_with/", "completion": "In most states, this is abandonment by the mother who is therefore automatically seen an an unfit parent in the eyes of the law.

The police would have no idea what state he was in. \n\nYou did exactly the right thing in putting him on his side, you could research fits to see if there was anything else to notice or do. He already was dealing with it via 911 so he was lucid up to that point, which is also consistent with a seizure.

{"prompt": "I (F19) and my cousin who I'll call D (M19) are strictly no contact and I actually refused to acknowledge his existence for a long time until suddenly I kept getting nightmares and panic attacks remembering what he did to me. (This gets a bit graphic)\n\nAround the age of 12 to 13, he came into my grandma's room took out his phone with the flash took out his penis right in front of me, and said \"touch it\" and to \"put it in your mouth\". I was completely freaked out backed up and only could say no. For the next 2 minutes, he kept trying to convince me \"it's finnnne\" or \"I won't show anyone\" and how if I don't do it he'll get me to do it. I was terrified and with my other older cousin being the only other person at the house, but unfortunately outside I was alone. I told him again no and got out as fast as I could, but he was following me. His penis is out and he is following me with his camera the whole time. I start running around the house and he's full-on chasing me at this point and I'm crying begging him to stop. I somehow figured out during all of this he wouldn't come outside where neighbors and my other older cousin could see so I ran to the front door and got out and he stopped chasing me finally.\n\nOn multiple other occasions, I would be laying down and be pretending to sleep and he would pretend to give me back rubs when other people would come in the room, but the moment they left he would grope me nonstop unless I faked sleep movements. I assume he was scared I would \"wake up\" during his weird sessions. Many times during the day he would try kissing me and forcing me to make out with him, but I always fought it which would make him chase me until I would cry or scream which made him stop eventually. Finally, it all stopped when I was too uncomfortable around him and had an extreme depressive episode so I never really saw them as much. I would see my cousins and aunt because they technically didn't do anything, but the moment he was in the room I left or I would sit silently in the corner.\n\nI unfortunately had a suicide attempt at 17 which is when I told everyone finally what happened and what he did to me. His mother (aunt) called me delusional and threatened a restraining order telling me I made it all up for attention. I went off on her telling her everything and immediately cutting contact with her and anyone else who decided I was lying. I didn't think it was worth it to give them a big fight I just wanted them gone. I loved my other cousins and aunt I genuinely didn't think she'd immediately blame me, but it is what it is.\n\nSadly another girl came forward not too long ago claiming he raped and assaulted her and my aunt told her the same thing she told me. Threatening her and saying how she is only saying the assault happened because he's successful and she wants to ruin his career. The girl who made the claims dropped it and refused to make contact with them just like I did.\n\nIt sucks knowing how popular he is now and seeing all of his fans while I am just in my room thinking about what he did to me and what another possible victim is saying.

{"prompt": "I am an essential worker so working from home was never an option for me. I leave every morning around 7am and come home around 5pm. My daughter stays home and does her online schoolwork. Today I was having some stomach issues so I came home around 1pm and as I walked into my apartment I heard male and female moans and a bed creaking. I immediately bolted into my daughters room and saw the neighbor on top of her. They had a blanket over them so I was spared from seeing what would have been a much more disgusting and disgraceful scene. When they noticed me they were scared out of their wits. I grabbed the neighbor by his neck and threw him out of my apartment and slammed the door shut to have the talk of a lifetime with my daughter. She initially was silent and refused to talk but after a few hours she answered some of my questions. Assuming she was being honest, I found out that she started this  \u201caffair\u201d by seducing the neighbor because she thought he was attractive, that the said \u201caffair\u201d has been going on since April, and that she really believed it was her fault and did not want to press charges against him. I wanted to sue him on charges of statutory rape, but much to my dismay the age of consent is 16 in the New Jersey so that is not an option. What other legal options can I pursue against my neighbor and should I take my daughter to a child psychiatrist? Thank you all.\n\nEdit: So I did call the cops and when they came they separately questioned me, my daughter, and the neighbor. After the questioning they told the that the most I could do is change apartments and get a restraining order against him for my daughter because based on what my daughter told them it seemed as if there was no coercion (apparently my daughter was actually defending him). Weirdly enough she also got angry at me and told me to just mind my own business and stop getting involved in hers. However I am starting to suspect that he might have brainwashed her over the past 8 months or that he might have some sort of \u201cdirt\u201d on her. In addition, I just realized the neighbor is actually 36 years old, which makes this entire situation even worse, because he was 32 when I moved in in 2016.

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."}
{"prompt": "my boyfriend has a fever of 103.2, can barely leave the bed, pounding headache, cough, chest tightness and the hospital discharged him fairly quickly saying it\u2019s \u201cpresumptive corona\u201d and he should just take tylenol and rest. they denied him the test for the virus! they said it\u2019s because of his age (23) and that he has no underlying health conditions (that he knows of) he is usually an extremely energetic, talkative guy and now he can barely keep his head up or move. I\u2019ve seen him sick before, and he was still 75% his self - this drastic change in his behavior and functioning is scaring me. I have never seen him this badly sick. I know that he\u2019s young, and there\u2019s a great chance he will be okay. But seeing more and more young people dying in the news is so so worrisome. I just fear the hospital wasn\u2019t careful with him because they were so eager to get him out. I\u2019m worried something bad might happen", "completion": "Emt student here so don\u2019t take my word as law, but, Covid is a virus so testing it would only confirm he has a virus and there isn\u2019t any cure. Hospital care is primarily assistive I.e. giving fluids. If he starts having breathing issues IMMEDIATELY take him to the doctor (if he can\u2019t breathe then they can put him on oxygen which is the only care that hospitals can give for viruses that most people can\u2019t do from home) but until then you\u2019re actually better off caring for him yourself. (Less chance of getting other illnesses, personalised more comfortable care that\u2019s more attentive) Gatorade is a great way to stay hydrated and keep your electrolytes up when you\u2019re throwing up or losing fluids out the other end. If he can\u2019t tolerate a higher fever you can use a painkiller to help but a fever is actually what causes the virus to die so if he can handle the heat, let him as much as possible. That being said there are some serious concerns raised about using NSAIDs such as ibuprofen on covid patients so Tylenol or aspirin (if his blood coagulates regularly) are your best bet for painkillers/fever lowerers. Other than that make sure he\u2019s drinking water/Gatorade. Eating food (remember bats: bananas, apple sauce, toast, soft foods) and sleeping as much as possible. \nIn short: the hospital was right to discharge him; he\u2019ll heal better at home for cheaper (if given above treatment) and a high fever is just a good sign of a healthy immune system that\u2019s fighting off a virus. If he starts to have breathing issues, then you should go back to the hospital.\nAs for preventative measures, make sure you\u2019re cleaning as much as possible especially in areas you share the most, bathrooms, sinks, anything your hands touch regularly. If you have them, gloves are great, if not wash your hands as much as possible (you should be doing that anyway tho). Masks are the most helpful thing. If you dont have a mask, layering up bandanas is better than nothing but a bra is also a good filter and I\u2019m guessing you have those so if you don\u2019t have a mask, wear a bra on your face even though it probably feels supremely silly. Don\u2019t go to the store during busy hours if you can help it and wear a mask or cover at the store in case you cough because you very well could be asymptotic right now.\nEDIT: I forgot to mention how important it is to *keep hydrated*. I literally cannot stress this enough. There is a type of shock (called hypovolemia) you can get from fluid depletion and if you\u2019re vomiting from both ends there is a chance you can lose too much fluid and go into shock. Usually this is caused by blood loss but with extreme vomiting from either or both ends (I really hate the word Diarrhea so, vomiting from the bottom is how I say it) you can actually go into the same type of shock. So STAY HYDRATED!\nEdit: a lot of sources are saying that NSAIDs are actually okay, I hadn\u2019t checked in a while so idk what to do with that but most of the concerns about NSAIDs appear to be just a coincidence at this point. Is probably safe to take them if you need to, that being said don\u2019t lower the fever too much or your body won\u2019t be able to fight the virus."}

I was diagnosed in the 90's, and in South Africa (so not top-tier medical services at this stage). They weren't entirely sure what caused it or what the best step. Long story short, I turned out just fine and even without surgery. Fast forward 20 odd years, and these things are less problematic, they're better understood, and treatment is far better. Recovery times are much quicker and chances for complications are lower, especially if you're in a country with good medical care.\n\nDon't drive, this could endanger others.\n\nHere's what I suggest you do:\n\n* Ask your doctor what type of tumor they think it is (Determine if it's malignant or not (it's usually not))\n* Ask about treatment. How to prepare for the surgery, what is the expected recovery time? and so on\n* If you're not 100% happy with your doctor, ask for a referring for a second opinion.\n* Put the medical dramas out of your mind. They're often focused on rare and unlikely scenarios, freak accidents, and overhyped/exaggerated with the medical jargon. You don't need that.\n* Inform family, and closest friends\n* Be prepared to stock up on movies/series/games etc. for your recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it seems daunting, but you're likely in the care of experienced hands who have done these procedures many times.

Speaking from experience as a fellow black girl, it all starts from within. If your self esteem is shaky, a mean comment could shatter your confidence. Stop caring about what they think of your looks, they\u2019re not important. What do YOU like about YOU. I know it sounds hard to build that confidence when people are constantly talking but it is a growth process, if you are willing to let the comments slide off your back, your confidence will grow. People are cruel (and black men especially) sometimes tear down black women for traits they see in you that they don\u2019t like in themselves (hair texture, skin color, lips, nose, etc.) Anyone who goes out of their way to be rude to someone just minding their business has low self esteem and they think making fun of you will make them feel better about themselves. If you ever need someone to talk to you can always dm me, I hate to see a black girl questioning her beauty because of ignorance."}
{"prompt": " So I'm 16F and I'm usually alone at home by myself all day because both my parents work until very late at night  and I'm online school but lately I've been seeing this white van with tinted windows pull in my driveway and just sit there for 15 mins. I opened the door and moved my hands like \"is there something you need \"but they took off really quick... I didnt tell anyone except some friends but 1 day later and I hear a car outside ( since I'm in the country I hear everything) so I look and there it is again just sitting there. I got scared so I called my parents and they said it might be the delivery people but i dont think that's normal.  My parents told me to not call the cops unless it's an emergency but now when I'm outside walking my dog I see this van frequently pass my house all the time. It's making me very paranoid and scared, I have the picture of the van as well.\n        \nUpdate - I saw the van again earlier this morning.  I contacted my local towns sheriff's department and they contacted my parents, they want me to send a picture of the van and they will be on the lookout.My mom is mad because she said its probably a dumb delivery person and now the police are   gonna be in \" our family's business \" and my dad told me to start carrying his gun with me while outside.

{"prompt": "So I(M) just got engaged to my girlfriend of almost 5 years.\n\nBit of a backstory, I have a brother (2 years older than me) that suffers with severe cerebral palsy due to complications at birth that resulted in a hemispherectomy procedure (where half the brain is removed). He has about the mental age of a toddler, but is none the wiser and is happier than the average person. He requires 24/7 care from my parents and additional support. No fault of his own, he is very vocal and loud. My parents life revolve around him 360 degrees and I always come 2nd. Fair enough.\n\nMy problem here started when I told my mother about wanting to ask my girlfriend to marry me and her first response was \u201cWill the venue be disable accessible?\u201d No congratulations, no tears, just concern about my brothers access.\n\nAfter proposing, the worries started to come. If we invite my parents and brother to the wedding, is the wedding going to revolve around my brother and his comfort and are they going to completely ignore me?\n\nThe selfish part of me wants to invite them bar my brother because I don\u2019t want to be sidelined on such an important day, if not the most important day of my life. (side note: they never attended my University graduation even though I asked months in advance and the excuse was they had to look after my brother).\n\nI\u2019ve came to the conclusion that I do not want my brother there anyway due to his vocal nature; he would be a very big distraction during such an intimate moment. I love my brother, it\u2019s not personal, I just don\u2019t want to be thinking about that during our special day. Plus he would be none the wiser to his surroundings.\n\n**My question here is**: how could I possible approach my parents about this issue without offending them?\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has concerns that when I talk to my parents, it will feel like this is coming from her and not me, possibly making her out to be the bad guy when this is 100% my worries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you to all that replied, I will respond to each tomorrow but for now, I feel the need to clarify a few details:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I planned on having a destination wedding with only us and a friend to officiate obviously not including witnesses but since COVID-19, travelling abroad just isnt possible to even plan as of now.\n\nWe have resorted to planning an inland wedding with a max capacity at the ceremony of 12 people. It is a very small gathering for us as we have an intamate circle of friends and family despite having extended family. My brothers presence would duly be recognised due to the small scale of the wedding.\n\nMy brother is also wheelchair bound and has many physical restrictions and due to this, finding a venue that isn't a social club just isnt possible. My parents have access to additional care, however, a respite home is out of the question due to abuse taking place in those institutions.", "completion": "To be completely honest based on their absence from your graduation this is likely a no win scenario for you.  I don't think that you could put it to them gently enough for them not to take umbrage at it.  So the best thing is to be gentle but firm, expect a bit of sturm and drang over it and try to be as understanding as you can about their emotional response."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Hi. I lost my girl a few weeks ago, and it was very sudden. I was able to only do a few small things for her, but I will tell you what I would have done if I had the opportunity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to feed her the best food I could; typically human quality food. She loved salmon, and I would feed it to her seared in some olive oil with butter and garlic. I think if your cat has a favorite food, then let her eat as much/whatever she wants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake sure she has access to all of her toys. Even if she does not have the energy to play with them; it comforted my cat when she was with them. There may be a few of her favorites that are stuck under or behind something, it could make her happy to see them again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if your cat likes to watch cat TV, (my cat loved the YouTube videos for cats, particularly the birds) but you could give her free reign of the TV for the weekend if she does. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBring a blanket with you. A big, soft fuzzy blanket for her to lay on. My girl sat on the blanket in my lap when they gave her the medicine.

{"prompt": "So. Yeah. My girlfriend walked out on us a month ago. She literally packed her shit and went while I was at work, just left behind a note saying she'd been cheating for a year and had moved across the country to be with the new dude. The relationship wasn't perfect and we certainly had some major problems but I didn't see this coming at all. I mostly blame myself. \n\nOur kid is 4. Thus far I've been telling him that mummy has just gone away to stay with a friend for a little while. But he keeps asking when she's coming back, or talking about things we can do when she gets back. He has nightmares 1-2 times a week and always wakes up crying for her. He rejects me on those nights because he wants mummy and her special song to soothe him and it isn't the same when I sing it. Twice he has gotten so worked up following a nightmare and asking for her that he's thrown up. There are days where he will literally sit for hours in our window watching our building's car park waiting for her to pull in. It's absolutely destroying me. \n\nI don't know how to tell him she isn't coming back without absolutely destroying his entire world. I've managed to get in contact with her three times since she left, and all three times I've begged her to at least call him or write him letters I can read to him or *something*, but she doesn't want to know. She says she isn't ready to give up her dreams yet in the way having a kid forces her to, that she's too young for this (even though I'm 4 years younger than her) and that she hates how she ruined her life and wants a clean slate. She and her new guy are moving to the States once the travel restrictions are lifted. There's no chance she's coming back for either of us. I can't let my kid going on hoping she is. It's not fair on him, and it crushes me to see how earnestly hopeful he is. What do I do? *How* do you tell a boy that little that his mummy isn't coming back?", "completion": "[deleted]"}
{"prompt": "I am an adult(22) living at home with my mom and my sister, who is underage.\n\n\n\nWe've lived in this neighborhood for 12 years and the person Im about to refer to has been here for 8. This is relevant only because he has not made contact with us at any other time in our lives.\n\n\n\nStarting in February this old guy who lived a few doors down approached my sister and asked weird questions about our mom. Maybe not weird but as everything else adds up, its becoming weird. He was asking if she(our mom) was seeing anyone and my sister said yes - even though she lied, she's uninterested in this guy.\n\n\n\nAfter my mom heard of this, she went and knocked on his door, making it clear that she is uninterested and seeing someone. Apparently he took it fine and the conversation ended civil.\n\n\n\nSince then, this same guy has been lingering near our home and has mentioned a few weird things:\n\n* He's made it known that he knows when our mother isn't home due to which car is gone at the time. He has **SAID** this.\n\n* He's made it clear he knows we have animals strictly due to the fact he said \"I came over and knocked but didnt hear any dogs, thought maybe you took them to the park or something\" - My sister and I are home more than average for people our age and havent heard him knock or seen him around outside of the times ive mentioned it here.\n\n* Somehow he knows when my mom *is* home BUT never comes and asks her these questions. He approaches my SISTER about questions referring to my mother.\n\n\nNow the most recent thing was **TODAY**:\n\nMy sister was laying outside on our deck tanning and he came from behind our house(*this isnt creepy in terms of where we live, all the houses are very close and we all share a field behind each home*) and started a conversation with her. The conversation was along the lines of this:\n\n(H = Him,  S = My sister)\n\n**Him:** \"Your mom doesnt really have a boyfriend does she?\"\n\n**Sister:** \"She does\"\n\n**H:** \"How come I never see him?\"\n\n**S:** \"He parks up the street since our two cars take up the driveway\"\n\n**H:** *Continues being skeptical and basically arguing and interrogating my sister*\n\n\n\nWith that conversation alone, he's making it clear that he's keeping an eye on us in some way. \nAfter my mom heard this conversation, she called the police and asked them to tell him to make it clear shes uninterested - since he's not listening to my mom.\n\n\nThey went to talk to him and we could HEAR HIM YELLING from 2-3 doors down when talking to the police. Why is **he** yelling while the police are telling him to stay away? They were arguing from somewhat of a distance in the middle of the road.\n\n\nThe cops afterward came back and even mentioned \"he's a creepy ass dude\" when referring to the guy. They said they made it clear that my mom is uninterested but if anything happens again, call immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing how he reacted, I am fully prepared for shit to go down. I do not think this is just a guy who will go away after this.\nHe is purposely coming around when he assumes im not around and being extremely weird.\n\n\n\nI will probably get comments saying \"*its not worth it*\" but I dont want my family to get hurt or even murdered and then live with the idea of \"man i shouldve did this or that\". (Note im not going to just go out and assault this guy for no reason, will fall under self-defense but i really do not feel like itll just be a fight - i feel like weapons may end up being involved.) This is why the title may seem a little dramatic. A normal fist fight isnt anything to fear or really prepare for, im almost *expecting* it to be much worse.\n\n\n\nI am very on edge and would like any advice that could be given.\nWe have a camera set up outside BECAUSE OF THIS GUY and we are waiting for my sister to come home so I can walk her inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 \n**(edit - June 1st)** \n\nWasn\u2019t expecting this to blow up.\nI won\u2019t be able to read or reply to every comment so I feel the need to add a few notes:\n\n\n* I am in no way intending on harming this person. This is not a threat or a plan. I\u2019m simply preparing incase it does reach an extreme level.\n\n\n\n* We do have one small outdoor camera, it snaps a picture every time there\u2019s any movement around it and it sends directly to our (my sis, mom and I) phones. We plan on getting a second.\n\n\n\n* We plan on getting a gun and a few baseball bats. My mom and sister both have pepper spray.\n\n\n* We can\u2019t move or stay with anyone due to the amount of pets we have and low income as my mom is the only source of income. My mom however is very scared and keeps bringing up the fact she wants to move.\n\n\n* While everything in the past has been odd and there\u2019s a bunch of warning signs, there *is* a small chance that nothing else will happen and he\u2019ll leave us alone. He hasn\u2019t come off as aggressive or perverted. However we know not to let our guard down.\n\n\n\nI will be sure to update/do a follow up if anything else does happen.\n\n\n\nThank you all for your replies and well wishes. Hopefully you guys are being safe as well with how much is going on in the world.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n**Update**\n(June 2nd)\n\n\nWe tried to get a peace order and got denied. Not enough evidence.\n\nAfter everyone got some sleep and was levelheaded, my mom decided she does not want a gun in the home.\n\n\n\nToday while my mom and sister were at their car, they saw the guy looking from his driveway/truck and when they(my fam) looked over, he put his head down. Might seem weird but I see that as a good sign.\n\n\nWe\u2019re much more calm now after getting some sleep but we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t let our guard down.\n\n\nMy mom and my sister both got pepper spray and we will be getting some baseball bats.", "completion": "Be prepared to call the cops at all times and ask them what could fall under self defence if you are obligated to engage.

All of my family is lily white with straight blonde hair so I am not fully confident in my ability to pick out the right products they need to manage any hair and/or skin concerns or what they might be.

We've been together for a couple months and it's probably the happiest i've been in a long time.\n\nSo, i brought her to dinner with my family, things were going ok at first. Aside from a joke someone made at her \"Oh, i didn't know your girlfriend needed to be chaperoned by her mom\" when she came in. But they asked her about her life, but then they started trying to fish for her actual age (Which i didn't mention. I just told her she was a woman). Asking who was president when she was born and stupid crap like that. I tried desperately to change the subject, but they kept making fun of her age. Then my little brother (17) asked what it was like to live through the great depression and they all made just other rude comments like that.\n\nThen it went from jokes, to just being rude. Like telling her \"Careful, this one might steal your social security checks\" about me. Something else about me \"Picking up chicks at nursing homes\".\n\nEventually she just stormed off, she started crying and ran away. I chewed them all out.\n\nMy mom even asked me \"Why are you doing this? Is it because i didn't give you enough attention growing up?\" I asked what she meant, she told me that since i'm \"Dating a woman your mom's age, it's pretty obvious you're trying to seek motherly affection elsewhere.\" Great, now she's implying i have some sort of fruedian complex.\n\nHow can i get my family to accept this relationship?", "completion": "This is basically the plot to that one episode of Family Guy.

{"prompt": "*EDIT*: I got a lot more replies than expected and I\u2019ve tried to read through as many as I can. I first want to thank everyone who gave their advice. While some of it did sting to read (the ones calling me a shallow asshole) honestly, it needed to be said. I really do regret the way I worded some things in this post and I admit it was immature of me to only talk about her looks and not her health. I promise I am deeply concerned about her health as well, I admittedly was not in the best mood when I wrote this, as I was feeling very frustrated.\n\nAfter reading through some replies, I am definitely going to make sure at some point she sees a doctor. Reading a lot of these possible health conditions she might have scares me and I want to make sure we get that figured out as soon as possible.\n\nThe second thing is I take full responsibility I\u2019m not doing my part with the healthy meals and exercise either. I would actually like to thank the comments mentioning that because it was something I did not even consider and needed to be made aware of. I am for sure going to take action and stop with the fast food because that is just as much my fault as it is hers. You guys are right, it is a team effort and I can\u2019t expect her to eat healthy if I\u2019m not willing to do the same. I also plan to step up and be more involved in the child care (watching the baby more so that she has time to exercise or just time for herself). It also helps that her mom is pretty involved too and I know she\u2019d be more than happy to watch the baby for us too if we need it.\n\nThird, I just want to clarify that I have never (and will never) called my wife fat, told her that\u2019s she\u2019s repulsive, etc. I would never actually SAY these things to her, I know better than that and I would never want to hurt her. I have never mocked or ridiculed her for her weight.\n\nFourth, to the people saying that I don\u2019t really love her or that I\u2019m being abusive, I am going to have to respectfully disagree with you there. I admit I sounded really shallow in my post and like a complete ass and could definitely have worded it better, but I\u2019d like to make clear that I absolutely love and am in love with my wife. Her wonderful personality hasn\u2019t changed since getting married and she has gone above and beyond as a mother. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to be the mother of my son. Aside from the weight issue, we honestly haven\u2019t really had any other major problems in our marriage. We get along really well and enjoy each other\u2019s company. I have no regrets marrying her, even with the weight gain. Of course I do hope she loses some weight but I\u2019m in no way feeling regretful about getting married to her.\n\nAnd this brings me to my last point- I\u2019m not going to divorce her. I saw a couple comments saying my marriage is destined to fail but I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not going to just throw in the towel that easy and walk out on our marriage and on our son. As I said earlier, I still love her very much and I wanna be there for her in sickness and in health. Yes we are religious too and we have both talked about and agreed on the fact that we would never divorce unless it was something TRULY worth divorcing over (abuse, drugs, infidelity, etc). \n\nAgain, thanks for the replies everyone and this has really led me to step back and consider my part in all of this too. I\u2019m feeling more hopeful after reading these replies and think that I have some good starting points to go from here (seeing a doctor to make sure this isn\u2019t a more serious issue for example being one of them). Thanks again everyone!\n\n*ORIGINAL POST*:\n\n22M here. My wife (also 22) and I both got married when we were 18. She used to be 125 pounds at 5\u20196. She was incredibly fit, had the most perfect body ever and even had abs. We had our beautiful son 2 years ago and she put on a ton of weight during her pregnancy. I know that obviously you\u2019re supposed to put on weight when you\u2019re pregnant but she put on way more than was normal. I thought maybe it would go away after the baby but it hasn\u2019t. She just keeps gaining.\n\nShe is still 5\u20196 but now weighs 215 pounds. I know this sounds mean but she is HUGE. I don\u2019t even recognize her anymore. I feel physically repulsed looking at her body and sex is awful now with her because I just can\u2019t get turned on. I feel terrible even typing this out but it\u2019s the truth. I haven\u2019t really told her how I felt, but she knows she is big and has tried multiple times to lose weight. She always gives up after a couple weeks and goes back to her old ways.\n\nThe closest she ever got was losing 3 pounds. Not joking. Then she gave up and gained it back plus more. I still love her deeply, she is my wife and I love our family. But I can\u2019t keep feeling like this in our marriage. How do I approach the topic of her weight with her without hurting her feelings? \n\nAnd by the way, I\u2019m not even considering a divorce. That isn\u2019t and will never be an option for me. But I really do want her to lose weight otherwise I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.", "completion": "Maybe get her thyroid checked out?

{"prompt": "I\u2019m sort of at a loss with this. To start off, I\u2019m 25 and my brother is 20. Our dad passed away a year ago and my brother had a really hard time with it. He eventually withdrew from college and moved back home to get his head straightened out. I was home visiting this weekend and everything seemed normal. We hung out, went out to lunch, my brother and I saw a movie together, we caught up, the usual family stuff. My mom converted my old bedroom into a home office, so I was sleeping in the guest room in the basement.\n\nLast night, after everyone went to bed, I snuck out back and blazed up. Don\u2019t judge me. I\u2019m not a pothead, but it helps me to relax sometimes. I came inside, watched tv, and around midnight was stupidly hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack.\n\nWhile I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard someone yell something upstairs but it was muffled. I went to the base of the stairs and listened and I heard was I\u2019m positive were sex noises from upstairs. I didn\u2019t think my mom or bro was seeing anyone and I definitely didn\u2019t thin anyone came to the house after I went downstairs. I was mostly just curious so I crept up the stairs a little and I could hear one of the voices was my mom for sure. I assumed it was just a booty call and maybe someone snuck in while I was downstairs. I went back to the kitchen, warmed up some pizza in the toaster oven and was eating it at the counter when I heard a door open and close upstairs, followed by footsteps, and then another door closing. Again, curious, so I went upstairs and went to my bro\u2019s room to see if he was awake and knew what was going on. His light was on so I knocked lightly and he answered the door in boxers and looking sweaty. He sort of jumped when he saw it was me, like he wasn\u2019t expecting it. He asked what\u2019s up and I said I thought I heard some noises up here and wondered if he had too. He got super sketchy and blushed and said he hadn\u2019t heard anything. I was super suspicious now and also felt super awkward bc it sorta seemed like maybe he had been involved in making those noises. I felt really embarrassed and weird and I basically gtfo of there and went downstairs.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep that night and today at breakfast things were way awkward with me and him and mom. Maybe I\u2019m being paranoid, I was smoking last night, but it feels like maybe they\u2019re having sex and I caught them. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crazy and there\u2019s another explanation or if I should say something. Part of me thinks if they are doing it they\u2019re both adults, but idk, it\u2019s got a major squick factor to it and I\u2019m sorta at a loss. Do folks think I\u2019m just being paranoid and, if not, should I say something?\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned that I\u2019m a female. Dunno that it makes a huge difference but Some people assumed I was a guy.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\n\nStill figuring out what comes next, but I got so much advice and so many responses last time I wanted to update you all. Last night, I pretended that I was going out for dinner and drinks with friends and said I wouldn\u2019t be home until late. I drove around the block, parked, and snuck back into the basement. And then I waited and listened.\n\nI heard the tv on and my mom and bro talking. I couldn\u2019t really make out what they were saying. Around 9 o\u2019clock they went upstairs. Once I was sure they were both upstairs I snuck up and listened at the base of the stairs (around the corner from the bottom so no one would see me). I felt like a nut but I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about all the what ifs. I heard voices from my mom\u2019s room; again too soft to make out. After maybe 20 mins I heard a moan. I crept up the stairs and when I was at the top I could hear what were distinctly sex noises from moms room.\n\nI crept down the hall to see if my bro was in his room, pushed the door open, and stuck my head in. At this point, I didn\u2019t care if he asked me what I was doing home, I figured if he was in there I\u2019d just tell him I came home early and wanted to hang out or something. But it didn\u2019t really matter. It was empty.\n\nI went back down the hall and listened at mom\u2019s door. It was mostly quiet, the sound of the bed, a few grunts, but I distinctly heard mom saying oh fuck a few times. After a few minutes they clearly had climaxed, somewhat loudly, and the noises stopped and I heard my brother\u2019s voice. He said he was going to take a quick shower. Then mom said she\u2019d join him.\n\nI was and am in a daze. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that they are having sex. I went back to the basement and I\u2019ve been lying here thinking for the last few hours. I haven\u2019t said anything to either of them. Part of me wants to burst in on them, part of me wants to confront my bro, I don\u2019t really want to talk to my mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a really weird position to be in.

{"prompt": "(idk if this is nsfw but tagged just to be safe) \n\n(F17)\n\nI discovered I had a septate hymen about a year ago when I first (successfully) put a tampon in. Long story short, when I went to go take it out, it wouldn\u2019t budge, so I took a mirror and discovered that a piece of tissue or something was straddling the entrance to my vagina. I eventually got it out myself by pushing the tissue to the side, which was a little painful/uncomfortable. I looked it up and I undeniably have a septate hymen. Basically what this means is that I can\u2019t use tampons or have sex (technically I could but it would be painful and in my case I think nothing larger than a tampon could go in). It can be fixed with a minor surgery. \n\nIt took me months to tell anyone about this, and today I finally told my mom.

{"prompt": "My sister is an 8th grader in middle school. Her bus arrives for school at 8:30 every morning. My mom leaves at 7:30 A.M. to go to work and I leave at 8:00 A.M. to go to college. We set countless alarms for her to wake up to, and we try to wake her up before we leave. My mother sets an alarm in her room and three alarms on my sisters phone. I am getting ready to leave when the first alarm goes off. My sister always walks to my mothers room, which is a good 20-30 feet away from her own,turns off the alarm and cozies up in her own bed. She has missed consecutive whole weeks of school, and I estimate she's missed about two to three weeks per nine weeks. My mom just got a new job after working ten years for the same company, she's on a 1 year probation period where the slightest mistake can get her terminated. My sister has missed so many days of school that my mother could possibly be fined or arrested. All my sister has to do is wake up, get dressed and catch the school bus, but she is too lazy to get up. We try finding alternatives for if she misses the bus, such as taking the city bus, but she is too spoiled to try and learn. Everytime I try to show her the route, she defies me and lashes out.\n\n\nI'm fucking sick of her, she talks back to our mom who tries to be gentle and calm with her, and she has the biggest fits over the slightest things. Our father travels around the country either working for a short period or sitting in jail. My sister is so unbelievably spoiled and she doesn't understand the consequences her actions have. She does awful in school, and my mother tries to punish her, taking her phone away, taking the TV cord, etc. But she either finds some way around her punishment, or she throws a fit. The only punishment she doesn't recieve is a spanking.\n\n\n Today was the last straw, I had food poisoning, so I was able to stay home. I made sure to wake her up and then I got caught up for about ten minutes in the bathroom. After getting off the toilet, I walk to her room to see her wrapped up under her covers. After missing a whole week of school for a \"leg injury\", she didn't get up today because she was \"too sleepy\". It would be one thing if she was stressed or overworked, but she clearly isn't, she never studies, does her homework, and she has an unhealthy obsession with discord (she doesn't even play games, she is just obsessed with whatever goes on in there). I immediately call my mom, who tearfully tries to plead with my sister to get up. All my sister responds with is a faint \"i'm sleepy\". She hands the phone back to me. I hear my mom sobbing over the phone, the last time I heard her cry was in 2007 when she broke up with my dad. I snapped and ripped the covers off my sisters bed and threw her in the shower and turned it on. I don't have a drivers license so I had to call an uber for her and she's currently off to school. \n\n\nMy mom can't pay for an uber everytime she wakes up late, and I had to use my scholarship money to pay for this. With how bad my sister does in school she might get held back. When I was in middle school, on top of having to wake myself up, I had to wake up a good hour before 8:00 A.M. if I wanted to make it to school and socialize with my friends before class started. It was a good 50 minute walk every weekday for three years, and if I didn't want to walk I had to wake up extra early, around 5:00 a.m, if I wanted my mom to drive me there. My sister is privellaged enough to get a school bus to come to our house which is outside the zone for the school she is going to, and she doesn't utilize it. If my mom were to get arrested or fined for my sisters' truancy she could lose her job, which is ridiculous. If my sister can make it past 8th grade, she will be in high school, and will need to wake up earlier than me and my mom, so we'll be home to wake her up. But with how things are going, I'm afraid she'll either be held back, or my mom might lose her job. At the very least, is there any way to absolve my mother of any consequences that are related to my sister's truancy?\n\nEDIT: I'm her brother\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all for your responses. Before I made this thread I suggested that my mom schedule an appointment with a therapist. We got an appointed scheduled with a doctor on the 6th that will suggest if my sister needs therapy or not. All of your responses have been extremely helpful. I was given a link to an article I shared with my sister to read and I sent the CINS/PINS Pdf to my mom so she could read it. I'm currently waiting for a response.\n\nEDIT 3: I know it seems like i'm making excuses for some of the answers in the comment, but you have to understand that my mom has financially and emotionally supported two children by herself over the past 18 years. We have tried being aggressive with my sister, even to the point of just throwing her outside her room. She will go limp and completely refuse all compliance. We have taken every source of entertainment out of her room, it enables her to think it's fine to miss school as long as she loses something. Some of these options do not work for how stuborn she is. She is a 14 year old, and has reached a point in her maturity where she could be considered a young woman. My mother seriously works her hardest to try to get through to my sister, she does not deserve to get her home, job, and life stripped from her over the actions of a stubborn 14 year old not going to school.\n\n\nEDIT 4: Probation doesn't mean my mom got in trouble with the law or her work, she's never been arrested in her life or faced a criminal charge. It just means she's new at work and any mistake could cost her job.", "completion": "I had this situation happen with my siblings and then years later a friends sibling.

It wasn\u2019t too bad because she just started going to school but I\u2019m sure it can be if the kid doesn\u2019t. \n\nThey reported her, they had an interview and she received a court date. During the court appearance the judge puts her on a type of REAL probation program and the consequence is you go to school or you become a ward of the state/report to training school. I can\u2019t remember all of the details but it\u2019s scary if the kid doesn\u2019t respond right. \n\nThe parents were petrified she would act up and face these consequences so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best recommendation but it might be worth seeing if your state has anything similar? To protect your mother and wake your sister up. "}

{"prompt": "I just woke up today to find out that my mom took my red-eared slider turtle out today and just threw him in a lake on the way to work. I\u2019ve had him since I was 10 and I\u2019m 16 now. My mom didn\u2019t like him because she said his tank smelled bad and always made a fuss about it. He also had an ear infection that I begged my mom to take care of but she kept insisting it would go away on it\u2019s own. He also needed a better tank and a better filter but my mom thought it was too big of a problem to fix. Basically, she didn\u2019t want to take care of him and cover the costs. It\u2019s not like we couldn\u2019t afford it, it\u2019s that she felt like she\u2019d be \u201cwasting\u201d money on a turtle. The fact that she just threw him out without telling me makes me furious. I could\u2019ve gotten a job and paid for the expenses myself. She joked about throwing him in a pond ONCE, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually do it. I had an emotional attachment to him and I miss him. Does anyone know if he\u2019s actually going to be able to survive? He\u2019s a red eared slider and he had an ear infection. Will he be able to find food?

I don\u2019t know if anybody remembers those \u201cGrow a Frog\u201d kits you could order way back in the day. They would mail you the little kit with a tiny frog and you could order food for it etc. Everything had to be ordered through the company. My mom got me one when I was like 11/12 yo (31 now). We had that first one FOREVER it seemed. We ordered another one because I liked it so much. Well apparently we had gotten one of each gender, because one day there were eggs in their tank. I decided to remove the eggs to see if they would hatch, and at some point my mom (not thinking it through) moved them to the windowsill. Eventually they hatched, and apparently the sunlight had been too much for them, because they were kinda deformed. Their front legs were.. I don\u2019t know how to really describe it... *stuck* to their chest. But they swam around great and seemed happy and ate well and grew. Now, these frogs were only supposed to get to the size of a half dollar. Ours got *big*- like the size of your fist or maybe a little smaller. The weird deformed ones never got as big as the \u201cparents\u201d but they got pretty big. We had a bigger tank and everything for them and they all got along well. They were entertaining. I digress.  \n  \nOne day my mom, my day, and myself left to go on a trip to Europe. My grandma came to take care of all of our pets (dogs, cats, an iguana, the frogs, pretty sure I had a hamster or rat at the time also.) We lived in a marshy area with a river nearby. When we got back, all the animals were fine, except my frogs were gone. My grandma said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand watching them swim around looking sad, especially the deformed ones, so she \u201creleased them\u201d into the river\u201d. I. Was. Furious. I had no idea if they could even *live* in that sort of environment and knew the deformed ones wouldn\u2019t last a minute in the wild anyway. My grandma apologized profusely when she realized her error, but it still hurt for awhile. It\u2019s 100% not acceptable to take somebody\u2019s pet and just \u201crelease\u201d it into the wild without your permission. I think the narcissist sub posted in here will help you a lot, but I just wanted you to know I feel your pain and understand. I wish there was something any of us Reddit users could do.  \n  \nEdit: I just looked it up and the kits still exist, but apparently they send a tadpole not a tiny frog. I kinda remember that now, so sorry if any information was incorrect in my post."}

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\n>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more.

Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\""}

{"prompt": "I\u2019m bound by HIPAA and can not disclose her health information, although she was not a patient in our hospital. We were told by administration. She\u2019s going to get people sick. She makes cakes from home where her boyfriend (who is also positive) lives, and there is no possible way the cakes she is making are not contaminated. What can I do? Anything?\n\nSmall update: Wow. Thank you all so much for reaching out with your advice! I feel much less crazy with all the support this has gotten. I got in touch with my local health services department and anonymously brought up the complaint. They took down a callback number for me (not my number, but a phone I have access to) and said they will call me back at some point today. I have very little faith in our local police so I\u2019m hoping this pans out.\n\nI\u2019d also like to say that this is more than just her making cakes while sick. She runs the business out of her home, where people come in and pick them up. As far as I know, she is not doing delivery right now. She interacts with these customers extensively, and even did a photo shoot with a 1 year old and the birthday cake she made for him over the weekend. This isn\u2019t a professionally run kitchen with mandatory precautions put in place. Right now, it\u2019s a really dangerous operation. \n\nWill do a final update hopefully later today with more information.\n\n\nUPDATE: I really wish I had a better update for you guys. I got bounced around between 4 different agencies and departments and sat on hold for hours just to leave a message for the final person I was redirected to. I called the local PD and they took down a report, but didn\u2019t seem all too concerned with it. Thankfully, I\u2019m not the only person with this information who is outraged and pledged to do something about it. Many of my coworkers are supposedly doing something about this as well. Although I\u2019m not throwing in the towel. I\u2019ll talk to my administrator and coworkers about this when I work tomorrow, and will absolutely tell you all the SECOND I have some solid information or hear back from any of the people I left messages for.

{"prompt": "8-year-old sister had asked me whether she was born was because of sex. I honestly answered \u201cyes\u201d because I knew she would find out sooner or later. Also, I don\u2019t have the heart to lie to her. Although I did not delve into the lovemaking details usually reserved for Sex Ed (penis goes into vagina, sperm fertilizes egg, etc), the way she phrased her question was one where you cannot fool her into thinking she was transported by UPS storks.\n\nI was slightly relieved she didn\u2019t press on for what I was taught in Sex Ed, but she has absorbed how pregnancy works, one by a tell-tale sign of missing a period (which she has not completely learned yet). She had gained this knowledge by subscribing to a YouTuber who talked about her pregnancy experience (I\u2019m guessing in vlogs and AMA form).\n\nHaving her own phone, she started to do something I only remembered doing first at 15 on my desktop: googling XXX on purpose. I thought she would be searching for the movie XXX: Xander Cage or the late rapper XXXTentacion (autofill gives his profile), she actually typed in XXX as in intent to enter a pornsite. She had clicked on images and had screenfuls of naked sex, with cum dripping out in some, faces of orgasm and pain in others and period sex in one image. Her curiosity ended up in me explaining to her that the cum is \u201cdischarge\u201d (which she didn\u2019t probe further into) and that sex is painful, comparing it to the most painful vaccination she remembered. She listened in awe, and I was asked if I had done it before with my SO. No, sis. (context: SO didn\u2019t consent, wanted to keep the V-card until marriage. But watched porn regularly and had friends who slept around)\n\nSince I had gone this far down the rabbit hole, I warned her that sex is by mutual consent ONLY, and she cannot do it until she is grown up (I regret not telling her both partners must be 18), and she must refuse any sexual encounters or I will personally hunt the predator down. I repeatedly emphasized that underage and/or non-consensual sex will get her and/or her partner thrown in jail.\n\nThe previous paragraph, yes, were big words for an 8-year-old, so I analogized it to a game of NERF (since she is a NERF enthusiast, and I have a NERF gun at home) - \u201cyou must get your friend\u2019s permission, and both you and them must be OK with playing NERF together. If your friend says no, and you shoot them anyway, you\u2019re a bully and will get into trouble. Because your friend already said no.\u201d\n\nNow, she remembers having the talk as the \"NERF talk\". I\u2019m quite shaken by this. I never had \u201cthe talk\u201d at home growing up, and I only had Sex Ed, biology, porn, and my friends\u2019 sexual experiences to formulate this. I am concerned with how much exposure she has when she is not with me or my folks. Should I let my dad know about the talk? Is it rude for me to tap her phone (personal property) and tighten Internet control? How do I approach this? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nAlso, if this is more appropriate for an asking parent forum do let me know. Thank you.\n\n**EDIT 1:** I have truly messed up by saying that sex is painful. Thank you for pointing it out. I was speaking about it from second hand accounts from my friends, who concur about the painful part. The orgasm/moaning faces that my sister saw appeared to be a look of pain to her (like a ear pull) so I had wrongly concluded. If she brings it up again I will correct myself.\n\n**EDIT 2:** To those who are @-ing me for giving her wrong info - I get it. I'm living in a household where \"the talk\" is straight up taboo. We all waited until middle school to have it, and it was conducted by our school. I have no choice but to step up.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Age of consent where I live is 16. Though the law views sexual relations from 16 to 18 as dependent on the relationship. If the offender was exploitative (i.e. a person of authority such as a teacher, coach, doctor) they will be charged.", "completion": "I don't think associating fear with sex is a really good idea. I had the talk at around 8-9, kids that age can handle that and if you mystify it too much or make it taboo then that might just draw her more to it because that's how curiosity works.\n\nAll kids want is to satisfy their curiosity, you can choose to help her do that in a healthy way or she'll find out in her own anyways, even if she doesn't have access to the internet her friends will fill her in, just like before the internet existed.\n\n\nBut yeah, she really should be monitored online, the dangers of sex apps and forums is just too high not just at this age but in the pre-teen and teenage stage as well."}

Our sex life is amazing, and we have a good communication in general. We go to the same university, we live about 10 mins from each other and in other words, things are good.

I was uncomfortable but my boyfriend initiated and it was fine. Not to get into too much detail, but there were a few red flags that kept coming up which I can\u2019t stop thinking about. For starters, they kissed each other, a lot, among other things I can\u2019t really get into here. But it was just off. \n\nNow I know how this sounds, I know I shouldn\u2019t have agreed from the start, but I did. And as a result, I can\u2019t look at him the same way.

{"prompt": "This is going to be a long read.....TL/DR at the bottom.\n\nCurious about my heritage, I submitted my DNA to two very reputable companies that asks you to basically spit into a little tube, secure it in a little zip lock bag and mail it out to them.  I received my results about six weeks later and when I went to the actual website to check out my results, I clicked on a tab that gives you the option to see who else has submitted their DNA  and how we are matched (genetically).  I found that many relatives that I know were at the top of my lists (on the two sites).  The way it works, is that the person whose DNA is closest to mine will appear at the top of the list as \"potential\" relatives.\n\nOn both sites, I saw the name  \"John Doe\" - name changed obv. - at the very top of my list.  He was listed as a first cousin.  I decided to check my inbox and saw that he had sent me a message weeks ago.  (I rarely check those sites).\n\nHe sent me a message stating that he saw that I was listed as his first cousin and if possible, could I contact him to see if I had any information about his birth father.  He went on to explain that by this point, he had already connected with his birth mother's side of the family and they all accepted him and he is now considered part of their family.  I decided to make the call.\n\nMy cousin told me that he was born in California, put up for adoption and was raised in foster care until he was finally placed with a nice family.  Since our genetic profile was so similar, he wanted to know if I could give him any information about his birth father.\n\nWhen he started asking questions, he told me that he was able to find his adoption paperwork from a Christian adoption agency.  I thought, \"hmmm, that's interesting.  Maybe I can provide some insight about our side of the family.\"  I wanted to help him as much as I could since I knew he was desperately trying to piece together any bit of information involving his father's side of the family.\n\nMy mother (RIP) has three brothers.  My oldest uncle is like a second father to me.  He actually married my dad's sister so his three kids are my \"double first cousins.\"  We all grew up together as one big happy family.  We shared all four grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.\n\nWe live in Texas so NEVER did I think that he could possibly be the son of any of my mother's brothers.  I was thinking that he was most likely the child of one my mother's many first cousins who lived in California then and continue to live there now.\n\nThen, he emailed me the adoption records.  His biological mother had provided all of the information to the agency; thus leaving this as an open adoption situation.  When I read the summary, his bio mom stated that the father didn't know about the baby and that he had already left California to return to his home state of Texas.  I didn't think much of it until there it was in black and white, my uncle's name was listed as the biological father.  I almost fell off my chair.\n\nHe was 19 years old when he fathered my cousin.  At the time, my uncle (and my mom) would go to California in the summers to work as migrants in the fields alongside my grandparents.  At summer's end, both he and my mother would travel back to Texas to resume their studies at their respective universities.\n\nI sent him a picture of my mom and my uncle.  I heard my cousin's wife let out a loud gasp.  She told me that my cousin looked exactly like my uncle.  Soon thereafter, my cousin and his wife started sending me pictures.  I was gobsmacked.  He looks more like my uncle than my first cousins that live here.  He is basically my uncle's doppelganger.  I was in shock.\n\nMy uncle is like a second father to my brother and me.  I don't think I would've been as shocked if my younger uncles had fathered this young man.  They were wild in their younger years.  But no, as it turns out, my \"second father\" has a son he never knew about.\n\nAs it turns out, he (my uncle) has four beautiful grandkids, one of which (was a semi famous) football player at a Big Ten University.  My uncle has two great grandchildren.  A son, grandchildren and great grandchildren that he never knew about.\n\nMy cousin had so many questions.  He knew absolutely NOTHING about his paternal side of the family.  In a matter of two hours, I provided a door into our lives.  He and his wife were crying.  I was crying.  I felt a connection to him.  His voice sounds like my uncle's.  His sense of humor and his love for his family and tender heart remind me so much of my uncle.\n\nNow comes the hard part.  I called my father to tell him about everything that I had just uncovered.  My father isn't an asshole but he is a very private person who doesn't take to change well.  As I gave him more information, he interrupted me and demanded that I CEASE communication with my cousin.  He stated that I've lived 45 years without knowing him so why should I begin to even care now?  He warned me that this could be a scam to extort money from our family.  We are not rich.  My father lives forty miles away and I asked him to drive to my house immediately because I was NOT going to go through this alone.\n\nWhen he arrived, he was still quite skeptical about the whole thing.  Being a man with a Master's Degree and an IQ of (not sure what it is but it's high), he insisted that this could be a hoax.  I told him, \"even if this was some random man claiming to be my uncle's son, GENETICS AND DNA DON'T LIE.\"\n\nI had printed out all of the pictures my cousin sent me because I wanted my father to see them on paper; rather than scroll through my camera roll on my phone.  Every time he tried to deny that this man wasn't my uncle's biological child, BAM, I'd place a picture of my cousin on the table for him to see.  Still, stubbornly, he'd say, \"he looks nothing like your uncle or your cousins.\"  Then, BAM, two more pictures.  His eyes widened, he looked uncomfortable and continued to deny that this man was related to us.  Again, BAM....more pictures.  After that, I presented my father with the adoption agency's summary.  As he read it, I could see that he was trembling.  Keep in mind, as I mentioned earlier, his sister is married to my uncle.\n\nFinally, he placed the pictures and the adoption papers to the side and looked me in the eyes.  He said, \"You are never to speak of this. You will cease all communication with this young man TODAY.  Yes, I do know that he is genetically tied to you and your mother's side of the family but SO BE IT.\"He stayed quiet, most like processing everything and finally said, \"If my sister finds out, SHE WILL DIE.\"  (My aunt suffers from high blood pressure).\n\nI started crying, calling him a \"cold and insensitive man.\"  I asked him, \"what would you do if you found out that there was a HUMAN BEING out there that could possibly be YOUR SON?\"  I told him that this occurred when my uncle was NINETEEN.  Yes, he was engaged to be married to my aunt but nonetheless.  He was a kid who made a mistake.  My father replied, \"It would devastate me.\"\n\nHowever, he reiterated that we will be taking this information to the GRAVE.   I talked to my brother about it and he said the same thing (my brother is an asshole).  I know that dropping a bomb like this would shake up my family to it's core.  However, my heart breaks for my cousin.  He wants to know so much about his dad.\n\nI'm 45 years old.  I'm old enough to make my own fucking decisions.  My father, as much as I love and respect him, is NOT going to dictate who I allow, and don't allow into my life.\n\nMy father ended up telling my uncle.  I couldn't stand not knowing what my uncle was thinking or feeling so I finally made the decision to call him.  I asked him to please go into a room where we could have a private conversation. I didn't have to say a word before he began speaking.  The first thing he said was, \"Mi'jita, I had no idea about any of this.  It was the 60's.  We were hippies.\"  I kind of chuckled at that but then he told me, \"If this gets out, your aunt will kick me out of the house.  I WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.  My wife, my children, my grandchildren.\"  As tears were streaming down my face, I promised him that I would, indeed, take this to the grave.  I have to respect his wishes. This is not my story to tell.\n\nSince then, my cousin and I have been communicating on a daily basis.  I told him that sadly, we may not have the \"happy ending\" that we were hoping for.  He understood. I'm sure it hurt him but I assured him that I would always be there for him as an extension of the one side of his family that he knew NOTHING about before.  He asked so many questions. It saddened me to think that our whole lives, we grew up in a loving, nurturing, and stable environment.  The irony in this situation is  that during this exact time, I had a first cousin who was entangled in the foster care system.  I'm not knocking the system itself, but he did share some very sad stories from his past.\n\nI gave him our family's medical history.  He shares many of my uncle's afflictions.  He promised me that if his father decides to never reach out to him, he would leave it at that and not create chaos within our family.\n\nHe is a kind, hard working family man.  I feel such a strong connection to him but this is NOT about me or how I feel.  I need to respect my uncle's wishes; however, I am not going to be cruel and cut my cousin out of my life.  Our daily conversations have turned into daily texts now.  In a perfect world, we'd invite my cousin, his wife, his kids and grandkids to come and meet us all.  I'd love to be at the airport holding up signs welcoming him to our city (and metaphorically, family).  I know that that's never going to happen.\n\nEdit: I realize that this is an \"Advice\" Subreddit and some have pointed out that I haven't asked for advice.  I apologize for that.  I feel like I'm drowning here and desperately need your advice.  I've read through many replies who have offered a lot of advice and that's exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you so much for helping me.\n\nTL;DR:  I submitted my DNA to two reputable companies.  My results came in and as it turns out, I have a first cousin who lives states away who was fathered by my uncle 52 years ago.  My family wants me to cease communication.  I refuse to.", "completion": "You\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nIt\u2019s fine for your father and uncle to not want any communication with your cousin. But they have no right to tell you that you can\u2019t. As you said, you\u2019re a grown ass adult and your cousin is your family. If you want to talk to him, you should. \n\nFrankly I think your uncle is doing your aunt a disservice by not telling her the truth. What happens if one of your cousins does a DNA test someday too? Things like this often have a habit of making themselves known, and I\u2019m sure your uncle\u2019s family would rather hear it from him as opposed to finding out in some other way. He\u2019s being very short-sighted. \n\nRegardless, good for you. You\u2019re making a huge difference in your cousin\u2019s life. You\u2019re a good person."}

I had told my brother that he could use the majority of the house for his activities (he likes to dress up like an anime girl) when he got home and my fianc\u00e9e was understanding of the situation. My brother pulls into the drive way and has brought his friend over who is a sex offender and makes me very uncomfortable cause I know what he did and there\u2019s no excuse for doing what he did.\n\n I didn\u2019t want my fianc\u00e9e around him so I told her that it was time to go. As I\u2019m walking her to her car I catch the friend staring her up and down. I promptly shot him a glare and walked her to her car to see her off. When I got back inside the guy starts making comments; \u201cwho\u2019s that\u201d, \u201caww I wish she didn\u2019t have to go\u201d, \u201cyou hitting that\u201d and so on... I let him know that she was my fianc\u00e9e and since he and myself aren\u2019t friends I wouldn\u2019t be discussing my relationship with him to which he quickly remarked \u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d be fucking her til she bleeds out of every hole\u201d. \n\nIt shocked me for a minute and I felt as if all the emotion in my body had left until the pure rage hit me like a semi truck and in an oddly calm tone that didn\u2019t seem like my voice yet came from my mouth I simply said, \u201cif I ever hear you say something like that again, I\u2019ll kill you\u201d. Now my brother is upset with me and is acting like I\u2019m at fault for the whole situation and has even demanded I apologize to his friend. I haven\u2019t felt close with him in a long time and he\u2019s been mooching off of me and my parents for some time now. I just can\u2019t choose him over my Fianc\u00e9e because I care more about her than I do about him. \n\nI\u2019ve had Army and Marine friends tell me that the feeling of emotionlessness before that rage sets in is normal and they\u2019ve felt it too when on deployments.

You 100% deserve an apology from him and the situation is not your fault at all. You clearly stated that you weren\u2019t comfortable discussing your relationship with him and he completely disrespected your wishes with that comment. The emotionlessness is definitely the initial shock before the emotions truly set in. If your brother approaches you about it again stand your ground and keep your cool. Good luck, I hope you get that apology."}
{"prompt": "Last night my little sister texted me on her tablet. She said she was \u201csad and embarrassed with a mix of disgust\u201d (her words.) I inquired why, and she replied: \u201ci like my best friend and she\u2019s a girl :(\u201c\n\nI took a minute just looking at that text and feeling so sad. Not because she likes girls, but because she\u2019s so upset about it. Ever since she could talk, I\u2019ve tried my hardest to raise her with the notion that some people like girls, some like boys, and some like both or neither. I do not stand as her parent in anyway and haven\u2019t lived with her since I was 17 (which was three years ago, but my parents don\u2019t go out of their way to let us know that it\u2019s okay if either of us specifically are gay. They\u2019re not homophobic as far as I know, but I personally haven\u2019t told them about how I like girls because I\u2019ve always felt that they would behave strangely about it. I don\u2019t know if my sister is upset because she\u2019s hearing something negative about gay people at home, or maybe at school. All in all, I\u2019m not sure what is making my sister feel this way.\n\nI called up my sister to video chat as soon as my sister texted me about liking her best friend. I told her about how I found out that I like girls in addition to boys when I was fifteen. She listened to everything I had to say, but if I asked her a question she would just stare at me. The poor girl clearly didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but still wanted to hear what I had to say. I didn\u2019t press her any further whenever she wouldn\u2019t talk to me, and I told her that it was okay that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. After that I asked her if she had told our parents, but she didn\u2019t answer. I let her know that it was okay if she didn\u2019t want to tell them, and that I hadn\u2019t told our parents about me liking girls, but that it was also okay if she did want to tell them. Overall she was quiet for the whole conversation, and I tried my best to remind her that liking somebody, no matter their gender, is an incredible thing as long as they\u2019re treating you well.\n\nI feel like I could be doing more for her. I remember trying to figure out whether I like girls or not when I was a teenager, and I can\u2019t begin to imagine what it\u2019s like as a child. This is an important time in her life, and I want to be there for her in every way that I can. It\u2019s hard when I can\u2019t relate to young children in this way, and also that we live in separate states from each other. The fact that she\u2019s hurting about this hurts me as well. \n\nWhat can I tell her?", "completion": "I read through the comments here and was surprised to find that nobody had mentioned this yet, but... Have you considered that it may be a possibility that she was aware of your sexual preferences already, and the fact that you haven\u2019t told your parents (or, for all she knows, maybe you had told them, and they had reacted poorly which is why it isn\u2019t discussed freely) has made her form some assumptions? Not saying that it\u2019s your fault or trying to place blame on anyone, I just wondered if you had considered it a possibility... \n\nPerhaps (albeit she\u2019s very young) she has felt this way her whole life, and she\u2019s reaching out to see if you can help her by kind of testing the waters with your parents, especially since you aren\u2019t stuck living with them like she currently is. I hope that makes sense.\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to edit and add that I DO think you handled the situation itself wonderfully, and I am sure that it means a lot to her to know that you love her unconditionally and support her.

It must have came out wrong though, because without missing a beat she says:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \"What would you like me to do to you? ...Or I can kiss you again?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe audacity and phrasing of the question stunned me. I never been painted into the corner with 2 false alternatives by a child. I chose 3rd option of \"We should call it a night\". She looked somewhere between sad, disappointing, and embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't decide what I should do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 1: Tell her really sternly that this behavior is innapropriate, and she should never do that. She's very self conscious and sensitive, and I'm afraid to make her feel like she's a bad person for what she did. I once told her jokingly to tie her shoelaces properly so she doesn't trip, and she still obsessively fixes them anytime I'm around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 2: Talk to her mother (dad is not in a picture... I know, shocking!...). I suspect her mother will chew her out, and tell her to never bother me again. I think that would be an overreaction, that might also damage her self-esteem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 3: Try not to be alone with her anymore. Ignore her affections as much as possible. Continue to gently remove myself out of difficult situations if they arise again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm leaning towards Option 3, since it requires minimum actions on my part. This allows me to avoid confrontation, spare her feelings, and preserve certain amount of normalcy without it getting too weird.\n\n\\*EDIT:\\* Thanks guys, you've been great. I never wanted this to get too popular, and I only expected 1 or 2 solid replies. I did however read through everyone's comments, and will continue to do so for as long as they come in.

This type of overtly sexual behaviour is extremely concerning at her age. I agree with the previous poster who suggested the girl have have been abused at some point. It may or may not have been her father or another family member, it could even be a peer closer to her own age who introduced these \"games\" to her, but somewhere along the line either she or her friend has experienced or witnessed overtly sexual behaviour that is inappropriate for her age.

{"prompt": " \n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI'm a 28 year old man. I have no job, no friends, no family.  I weigh 550 pounds. I am on SSI disability for anxiety and PTSD and my weight. I have been homeless on and off since I was 16 years old.  I am on a waiting list for public housing. I'll be in an apartment in a month or two.\n\n\n**How do I build a life?**\n\nThis is going to be long, sorry about that. And sorry for any spelling errors. It was very emotional for me to put all of this into words.\n\n\nI was raised by two horrible and sick people.  My mother  is a narcassist and paranoid schizophrenic. I have had no contact with my mother in 10 years. My father is a pedophile, rapist and has borderline personality disorder.  I have had no contact with my father in 2 years. \n\nWhen I was young, my parents kept my sister and I completely isolated from people and culture. I have never played with a child my own age. I never learned to play or socialize with anyone.  She would read the bible to me and my sister for hours a day. We  were technically homeschooled, but never learned anything except the bible.  When my parents would leave, they would lock us inside the house, and tell us that if we left, people would kill us or abduct us or corrupt us.  \n\nWe had a small TV in the house, but no TV antenna. It was only for playing  certain videos that my parents approved. We could only watch church material and a few old movies. When my parents would leave the house, my mom would take the TV with her and lock it in her van, so we couldn't watch anything without their supervision. \n\nMy mother also would regularly starve us. My mom was obsessed with health. She always thought she had cancer or something.\n\n She would feed me a tiny bowl of plain oatmeal for breakfast and a few leaves of lettuce and a small chunk of tuna(maybe the size of a quarter) for lunch.  When both parents were home, they'd almost always fight, and they'd each end up in different rooms, and my mom would be crying and my dad would be sleeping. My mom would say dinner was \"fend for yourself\".  We rarely had family dinners. I don't even remember them.  My sister usually make food for me and her. She'd make me ramen noodles or spaghetti or mac and cheese or whatever for dinner.   \nMy dad would over feed me when he could. On weekends he would take me to the McDonalds drive through and buy 12 cheeseburgers and let me binge. This was the only \"real\" food that I'd get for the week. My mom would never allow me to eat fast food.  My parents would eat their own food, but feed us crap. We weren't allowed to have the \"adult food\". (By the way, I thought this was normal until a few years ago).\n\nIt was pretty common for my sister and I to go to sleep hungry, and then with my acutely developed sense of smell, wake up and unbeknownst to them, sit at the top of the stairs, watching them eat pizza  and take out chinese food and other \"adult\" food.\n\nWhen I was 10 years old, my dad left my mom, and took my sister and I to live with his mother on the other side of the country. To my sister and I, he was rescuing us. We loved him for this. We hated my mom.\n\nAt 10 years old, I was a horribly weird child. This was in the year 2000. I had never heard any music with lyrics before in my life. My mom would only let me listen to classical music because she was worried that the lyrics in music would corrupt me. \n\nI had my dad buy me a CD to listen to music for the first time. It was Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. I was blown away. I didn't even know people could make those sounds with their voices. \n\nThis is where my life opened up incredibly. Everything was amazing. My world got HUGE overnight.  TV, Music, culture, THE INTERNET! My dad bought my sister and I computers. I spent most of my teen years on my computer. It was amazing to me.\n\nAfter moving across the country, my dad divorced my mom and got full custody of my sister and I. He enrolled us in school, and I went into 5th grade, and my sister in 7th. \n\nIt was terrifying. I didn't even know how to talk to anyone. I had never met anyone my own age before. I didn't know half the words they were using. Everything almost sounded like a foreign language to me.  This lead to me being really awkward and getting bullied a lot.  I ended up dropping out of school when I was 13 and my sister did the same when she was 15.\nMy dad told the school that he was going to homeschool us. He never did.  We never did any homeschooling. I never graduated high school. \nAround this time, my dad started feeding me. And feeding me, and feeding me. I never had a mom to starve me. My dad had no idea how to cook. Every day was like this. Breakfast: 4 sausage mcmuffins, Lunch at the all you can eat Chinese Buffet, and dinner was a bucket of Fried Chicken. This lead to me ballooning to over 400 pounds by the time I was 14.\n\nAround 2004, my dad leaves his PDA(kinda like a smartphone, minus the phone) in his car while I'm waiting for him. I decide to play a game on it. While I'm looking through it... I find pictures... of my sister. Naked. And pictures of various female family members(my grandma, my aunt), their heads photoshopped on to pictures of naked women, and lots of child porn.  I am confused. I have no idea what to make of this. I'm  14 years old. I quickly put the PDA away and pretend I never saw it. Over the years I'd realize the way my dad treated my sister, and it made me sick inside. I was worried he was molesting her. Apparently I learned last year from her, that he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14. And I mean \"teach\" her.... physically...\n\n---- \nMy dad was kind of a scam artist(I did not know this  at the time). He didn't have a job. What he did was go to desperate people who wanted to get out of their mortgages, and \"buy\" their houses, and then rent them out. Turns out he didn't really buy them, he got them to sign a quit claim deed to him, and they still kept the mortgage in their names, and he would rent the houses for a price over the mortgage. The owners kept the mortgages in their name, but my dad paid the mortgages with rent money from renters. He'd then \"rent to own\" those houses to people that would put $5000 down to buy these houses from him. \n\nHe did this for a few years until he had 20+ houses. In late 2006, he decided he didn't want to be in this job anymore. He took all the rent money for October 2006 and didn't pay the mortgages, causing all of the old people he got the houses from to default on their mortgages.\n\nConveniently, my dad decided that we would drive acrossed the country to go on a long water fast together to lose weight.  So he drove us out to the Arizona desert in 2006 in a big box moving truck, and we both sat out there reading books for 40 days straight without eating, and only drinking water. (Now that I think back to this, I think this was child abuse, but I thought it was good at the time because I lost 100 pounds).\n\n\nWhile we were out in the desert, all of his houses were being repossessed, including our own house.  When we got back we had no where to live. My sister was 18 at this time, and luckily for her, she had moved in with her boyfriend. I was stuck with my dad.  \n\n\nOver the next 4 years we would be mostly homeless. Sometimes  squatting in abandonded houses, and during winter times(this was in Michigan), my dad put on a suit and tie and  would rent an office in a run down office building for the winter to keep us out of the cold. We'd sleep in offices while he cooked up another business plan that would eventually fail. Oh yeah, and I gained back the 100 pounds that I lost during this time, plus another 100 pounds for good measure.  In the summer of 2007, my dad convinced his mother to give control of her business, a well established local pet store, over to him.  We'd live in the back of the store. My dad did a lot of \"renovating\" of the store, but in reality was inflating the costs of the renovation and taking out loanss and skimming cash off the top.  By October 2008, this store of 40 years was out of business and all the employees were out of a job, and we were homeless again.  \n\nSo what did my dad do? Did he get a job? Nope.\n He put on a suit and tie, went to another run down office building, and rented out an office for $350 bucks a month for some new bullshit business for the next year. I went with him, because I had no where else to go. \nIn the middle of winter 2009, his office building was set to be demolished so it could be turned into a parking lot for the new YMCA, so we were once again homeless. My sister begged her boyfriend to let us move in with him. He hated my father. But he eventually let us move in, but only for a few months. \n\nMy dad ended up concocting a new plan while we were there. He decided that we should both go to college together and becoming nurses.. I was now 20 years old. He's in his 50s. At this point,  I  only have 2 years of elementary school under my belt.\n\nHe decides to make up some fake  trans scripts and a diploma for me, and has me apply for college out in Arizona, and of course apply for loans and grants.  \nThe community college there is incredibly cheap, and we'd end up getting a few thousand dollars in refunds back from loans and grants each semester, so it would pay for us to live and survive. He also faked some records so I could get in state tuition.\n\nSo we move out to Arizona, and now I'm in community college, totally unprepared, and every semester, further indebting myself for another one of my dad's schemes.  We do this for 3 years and I fake my way through college, really going nowhere. My dad encourages me to just take a bunch of classes to figure out what I want to do with my life, as long as I stay in full time so I can keep getting money to pay him for rent. My dad also has not taught me how to drive. Now I realize that he did this to keep me dependant on him. \n\nWhile this is happening, my sister loses her job and has a mental breakdown, tries to kill herself, and is hospitalized for awhile. She ends up getting on disability for her mental illnesses and is still on disability today.\n She is worried about me, and comes out to visit me in Arizona. She eventually helps me by buying me a car. I take the car, and teach myself to drive, against my dad's wishes (at this point, I'm 23, she's 25). Within a month of having my drivers license, my sister convinces me to move back in with her and leave my dad in Arizona. Now I see my dad cry for the first time ever. He's begging me not to abandon him. I almost decided to stay, but my sister begged me to move back to Michigan with her. So we did. \n\nImmediately after we left, my dad stops paying the bills(which are all in my name by the way, I did not know this, and this ends up ruining my credit). And he moves into his car.  \n\nWithin a month of living with my sister in Indiana, I have a job. Another month and I make some friends at work, and a month later I move in with 3 of them and we all share a house. This is by far, the best part of my life. I smoked weed for the first time with my new friends, and it was transcendent. I was having a great time. I'm working full time, 40-50 hours a week (just at walmart, but I actually loved my job). Every few days, I get emails from my dad, telling me how miserable he is living in his car, and how dangerous it is for him to live there. \n\nAfter 8 months of this, life is going great for me. And my dad shows up at my house in Michigan. He gives me a sob story and convinces me to let him live with me, in my bedroom.  He mentions that he wants to kill himself all the time. I reluctantly let him move in with me, but tell him he can only stay for a month, and he needs to go to the homeless shelter. \n\nOver the next month, he hates that I'm working full time. Its the holidays and I'm really busy at work. He resents that I'm working and I'm self sufficient. He sleeps all day while I'm at work and stays up all night in my bedroom on the internet watching movies and videos while I'm trying to sleep. My performance at work starts suffering... \n\n\nI end up getting injured and losing my job at walmart. I was clumsy because I was sleep deprived.  My dad seemed happy that I lost my job... I ended up telling him to leave. I can't handle it anymore. He moves out into the homeless shelter. He's furious at me. \n\nI decide to go back to college. I finally found a career that I think I want. I want to be a paramedic.  I go down to the local community college and sign up. I take out loans and grants to support myself.  A few weeks later I show up for my first class. \n\nGuess who's sitting in the front row? \n\nYep. My dad. He wants to be a paramedic now too. \n\nThis was a miserable semester. It was so fucking embarrasing to be in the class with my dad. I end up passing the EMT portion of the class, the first semester, and I drop out of the paramedic training. I just don't want to be around my dad.  \n\nAround summer of 2014, my dad asks me for help cleaning out his storage room. I reluctantly oblige and help him.  I noticed something in the corner of the storage room. Its a locked aluminum box. I've  seen it before many times, and always wondered what was in it.   While he's doing something in his van, I check out the box, Its actually unlocked, so I open it. Inside.... is hundreds of  pictures, a few hard drives, KY jelly, tissues, and... my sister's underwear.  I slam it closed, and walk out of the storage room and take off. I left my dad without any explaination. Later that night I felt a horrible pain in my chest. I think I'm dying. I can't breathe. I can barely move. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. There is crushing pain in the center of my chest and radiating up my face and down my arms. I'm sweating, I'm numb, and cold.  I stumble outside and call 911.  I tell them I'm dying. I'm having a heart attack. I'm only 24 years old.\n\nAfter being in the hospital for 2 days, and undergoing cardiac stress tests and ultrasounds and everything, they diagnose me with panic disorder. It was just a panic attack. That's what a panic attack is? I had no idea. This felt real. It couldn't just be in my head, could it?  \n\nOver the course of the next few months, I have these same events 3-4 times per day. I feel like I am absolutely, 100% dying, multiple times per day. My dad is now an EMT with the local ambulance service. If I call 911 again, he might be the one showing up  at my door.\n\nIt takes a few months, but I eventually break down and tell my sister what happened. I tell her what I found 10 years ago, and what I found 10 years later in his storage room. My psyche was not letting me hide this anymore. My sister felt terrible for me, and told me that she knew something was wrong with my dad. She told me he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14, and tried to get her naked multiple times.\n\nShe decided to confront him. I couldn't bare to look him in the face. I was a coward. I couldn't look at him. I left her to confront this predator alone. \n\nShe tells me that he told her that he admitted it. He said that he likes incest. He told me he'd get counselling for it.  My sister and I decided to cut off contact with him. This was in 2015, and I haven't talked to him since. He's emailed me a few times and told me he got concelling for it and is better now. He told me the consellor said that being attracted to his daughter was normal, and was understandable because the pain he went through with the divorce (???? bullshit).\n\nAnyways, after all of this, it basically destroyed me. I couldn't work. I was having panic attacks every day. My sister convinced me to apply for disability. I did, but it would take 2 years for me to get it.\n\nWe both had no where to go. We felt unsafe sharing the town with my dad.  We decided to move to the woods in the middle of the country. We found a place that sold empty property with no money down, and we got 5 acres out in the middle of the woods. There was an old abandoned meth cooking shack on it. We found a lot of meth pipes in it. We cleaned it out and moved in.  My sister and I lived there for 2 years while we waited for me to get disability. I needed it. I was agoraphobic(still kinda am), and I needed to heal and be away from people. \n\nOnce I got disability, my sister wanted to move back to live with one of her friends in Indiana. I applied for public housing in the local town closest to me in Missouri. I was approved and have an apartment waiting for me.\n\nFor the first time, at 28 years old, I'll be living by myself. Rent and utilities is 30% of my disability check.  After rent, I'll have $500 to spend per month. After other bills(phone/car insurance), I'll have $400 per month.\n \nSo here is my situation: I'm in the middle of the country, alone, no job, no friends, no family, no high school diploma, 550 pounds, and on disability. \n\nI do not want to stay on disability forever, but I'm not sure where to start building a life. I am very alone, and I've never been completely alone before. I'm scared, and could use advice.\n\nThanks, and sorry for the long post and if it was rambling and confusing.\n\nedit: I got the apartment! https://i.imgur.com/cw312ni.jpg", "completion": "First, I read every word of your post and a few things struck me.

{"prompt": "So I bet a guy from work (3 weeks after the election!!) $5000 that  Biden would be President on inauguration day. He was drinking the kool aid hard reading all sorts of crazy shit 1000% convinced Trump would remain in office. He'd send me Tik Tok videos as proof every day of random ass  people explaining how it was going to happen. Seeing how relentless he  was I said why don't you put your money where your mouth is. Soon enough  a $500 bet quickly escalated into a legit $5000 bet after lots of  ridiculous back and forth.\n\nSo here we are, I won, and you're not gonna believe it but the Trump guy is being a sore loser!! He is 100% going to pay me but he is  trying to win the only way he can - by making it a pain in the ass for me to get my money so he can have a laugh.\n\nHe has ordered 75 small aluminum pill containers ([see here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C14SXSM/)) and has about 15 home depot buckets ([see here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613)) which he intends to fill with  concrete. As of now his plan appears to be to put hundred dollar bills  (50) scattered throughout the pill containers and buckets of concrete. Rebar or wire mesh may be used. He included me in a giant work group message where he is grandstanding  his plans ([see here](https://imgur.com/a/6rOaOKj)) - that's how I know all this. Once again this  is the only way a guy who just lost $5000 can \"win\" - right  out of the Trump playbook!\n\nAt this point his intention is to make me work as much as possible for the money for a laugh. He  certainly will put more thought into making this a pain in the ass for  me than he did making the bet in the first place.\n\nMy goal at this point is to give him as little satisfaction as possible or even flip this in my favor and completely take the wind out of his sails. Since he revealed the pill containers he ordered, as a preemptive strike plan, I went ahead myself and ordered 75 of them as well.  They'll be here Friday along with a stack of fake hundreds from Amazon. Here's a couple  scenarios:\n\n1. He does not put the money in any of the pill containers in an  effort to simply hand me the money after I crack through all the  concrete just to have a laugh at me. IF he does this - I could open 2-3  buckets to get a gauge for what's in the buckets/containers. If it  appears the are empty I present to him my own 75 pill containers that I  easily covered with my own concrete mix and he would thus unknowingly  foil his own plan. At this point I'd feel him out for info and see if he  turns over money then. I'd pretend he got me good (video and all) then I  could then drop the full concrete buckets in his truck and send him a  video revealing I have outsmarted him. This is best case scenario.\n2. He fills 50 of the 75 pill containers which would make sense for 50 $100 bills and 75 total pill bottles. In this case I'd have no choice  but to go through them all. This would be his best move guaranteeing I  go through them all. In this case my only winning move would be to dump  the 75 containers that I ordered (with concrete on them) in his truck at  work the next day to make it seem like it only took me one day to get  the money. Then later just chip away at the buckets myself.\n3. I have to crack open all the buckets but then fill my own buckets with pill containers and concrete and give them back to him. The ol' bait and switch. I can also preemptively do this - so almost on the same day or next day I give them back to him so he thinks they are the same buckets he gave me and develop a story around that. Photoshopping pictures is an option as well.\n\nHelp me out Reddit! I either need a good counter plan or some good advice on getting these containers out of the concrete! A hammer drill? Could I drop them from the top of a bridge? Or find someone with an old fire department ladder truck and rent it for an hour to drop them from the top?\n\n**Current payback plan:** u/[amasterblaster](https://www.reddit.com/user/amasterblaster/) has a brilliant idea. Take the fake buckets to his house. Offer a $2000 settlement if he takes them back. If he says no leave the buckets. If he says yes go directly to ATM get $2000 from him. Let him crack open all the staged buckets - then when he comes looking for his 2 grand back I give it back to him in concrete!! Or I plant the 2 grand in the buckets so he realizes theres money there but comes up $3000 short and realizes his folly.\n\n**Current concrete busting plans:** Sledgehammer for potential simplicity, dexpan a non explosive expanding agent for concrete, rotary hammer, or a simple excavator to smash the shit out of the blocks.\n\n**Few responses to comments:** I'm not suing him. I'm not turning him into authorities for ruining money - its not getting ruined. He 100% IS paying the money. I've known him a long time this isn't a random person. He's just busting my balls.\n\nP.S. I couldn't in good faith take the money knowing some people died because of this conspiracy theory so I am donating a portion of the  winnings to the deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick's family.

{"prompt": "UPDATE AT BOTTOM\n\nMy coworker recently lost his car--don't know the details, probably broke down or something.  He had to cancel his own wedding for his son's funeral last weekend.  He's in a really shitty spot.  I don't think this guy is one of those \"make someone feel sorry in order to take advantage of them\" types so...\n\nI was already kinda half-ass looking around at newer cars, waiting for a deal for a few months now but not *needing* one ASAP.  When I heard this guy was ubering to and from work every day I was like, holy shit I'll just go ahead and pull the trigger on a new-to-me car and give him my old car.  \n\nI have decided I'm going to do it but I have no idea HOW to do it.  I want to preserve his dignity so I'm not going to make a big show of it, in fact, I really don't like the fact that our coworkers will figure it out when they see him driving my car.  I don't feel like I'm doing it for self-aggrandizement, everything just happened to line up to where I can really help this guy.  I'd have donated it to NPR because I wouldn't get much in trade and don't want to hassle with selling.  \n\nHow should I approach this?  What is the most graceful way to give this to him, and refuse payment if he offers it, and not let it be weird?  I mean, I know I can only control my side of things but if there are some things I can say or do that would make it easier I'd appreciate some insight.  \n\nIn my mind, I was thinking of inviting him into an empty office and just being like look dude.  I want you to have this.  But then... what?  What if I offend him?  What if he refuses to take it and continues to Uber into work?  What if he gets weird afterwards?  My boyfriend said I should offer to sell it to him for a super-low price so it doesn't feel like charity, but I feel kinda tacky being like \"hey I know you have all this shit going on but if you give me 500 bucks I'll give you my car\"?  Nah that won't work for me.  Maybe I could offer to sell but be super insistent that I will NEVER ask him when he will pay me and he can get it back to me whenever he wants, 5 bucks at a time if he needs to but really I am not trying to make money off this.  I just want to help my colleague.  He's kind, warm, and hard-working and he's dealing with a bunch of shit.  A big steaming shit pile.  I can't sit here KNOWING I can help him and just ...shake him down or do nothing.  \n\nHow do I even remotely handle this\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo, I showed up right as he was walking across the lot to his truck to leave for the week.  I ran up and was like, \"hey!  How you holding up?\" He sighed heavily and said \"I am getting through it because I must get through it.\" I asked, \"Have you come to a solution for your car problem?\" And he sighed again and said, \"Yes, the solution is that I must have one and can't afford another.\" We were about 20 yards away from employee parking and could see both my cars so I said, \"Well, this weekend I bought that car (point at new car) and so now I would like you to have that one (point at old car).\" \n\nHe was absolutely speechless, so I kinda started talking fast and was like \"I couldn't find the title--it's in my closet somewhere--but I have all the necessary paperwork you need to bring to the Iowa DOT to transfer it into your name.  I'll pay for a replacement title if I can't find it, and it's overdue for an oil change so I'll get that done this week while you're out too.  I'll leave the keys on my desk so you have them if you get back after I leave on Friday.\"\n\nI attempt to look in his eyes but his mask has fogged his glasses.  I continue.\n\n\"Yeah, they only offered me 98 dollars for the car and I didn't think it was worth it and I didn't really want to hassle with selling it online.  Also I don't have space at home to keep it, so I thought to myself, *why not let [coworker] have it?* So here we are.\"\n\nHe has begun shaking.  It's 15 degrees so I am getting pretty cold at this point and I start hopping a little.\n\n\"So...would you take my car please?\" I ask, by way of concluding the offer and requesting some kind of feedback. \n\nImmediately, he grabbed me around the shoulders and pulled me in for a long, strong hug.  He is openly weeping into my hair now.  He is saying something but my scarf is muffling his words, but I let him hang on until he decides to pull back.  Finally he removed his glasses, and he looked me in the eyes and said, \"You have changed my life with this gift.  I cannot describe what you have given me.\" So of course I started crying and we hugged again.  Then, he said I must be freezing and I am to go into the office immediately, so I did.  He sat out in his truck for a while before finally leaving for the week, and I feel content that he did not insist on haggling over money.  Perhaps if he decides later to bring it up, I will entertain what he has to say, but for now I am well satisfied with how this turned out.  Now I just have to find that damn title \ud83d\ude35\n\nI want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read this and took the time to reply.\n\nAs it turns out, I was totally overthinking how this was going to go!", "completion": "I'd make sure i had all the transfer papers with me and like you said take him into an empty office.

I wasn\u2019t crazy about it, but I respected his lifestyle. \n\nThis May, we made the hard but logical decision to separate because our careers were taking us down very different paths. But a month later we decided to get back together because we loved each other that much, and wanted to make the distance work.

This wasn\u2019t exactly new behavior, but he was always apologetic and I, knowing his struggles with depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma, was always forgiving. \n\nA week ago, he got drunk and was being verbally cruel again. He texted me goodbye, and the next morning I had his friend check on him and his body was found. I was devastated, blaming myself, and was making plans to follow him out [ plug: I am no longer feeling suicidal] During the visitation and funeral, his family were so kind to me and I didn\u2019t deserve it. \n\nAfter the funeral, the girl he had been sleeping with was sharing stories, and I picked up on some things that indicated to me that they had been together the last 2 months. After speaking to her, I learned that he had told many of his friends that we had broken up a year and a half ago, and that they\u2019d been dating the whole time. I confirmed it with others, and saw the texts. \n\nThis began a rabbit hole of learning that he had also slept with at least 2 other people in the last 6 months. Saw the texts to confirm.

I also found nudes from dozens of other people backed up to his computer 6 months into our relationship.\n\nHis family and other friends keep telling me he really loved me, that I was important to have been the only one to meet the family.

Also if anyone could give me any advice on how to get him out from under my bed without scaring him or grabbing him that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT:UPDATE\n\nFirstly thank you all for the advice! I coaxed him out from under my bed with a little plate of tuna and he seemed to enjoy that. I sat on the floor with him for a while and gave him some water. Decided to open my back door (downstairs) just incase he wanted to leave and he got up and walked down the stairs and out the door - i'm hoping this is just some kind of cat intuition because otherwise god knows how many times this cat has been in my house to know the layout of it. Did feel a little bit heartbroken honestly but he actually just sat under a bush in my garden for a while, so I left my back door open incase he wanted to come back inside. This was a little while ago so i thought he's probably gone by now, but just stepped out into my garden and and guess who's here! I'll leave the backdoor open if he feels like coming back inside but he seems pretty chill just wandering around. He can hop my neighbours fence so I think he'll be on his way. Hopefully he'll come back tomorrow, but glad the little guy kept me company for a bit in quarantine anyway. Hope he finds his way home soon, thanks again for the advice everyone :)", "completion": "That's how you get a cat in the first place.  \nCheers, you're a cat owner now!  \n\n\nI ended up having 6 cats this way..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, so I was on a walk around 1pm today and saw this little girl walking by herself in her pj\u2019s. I stopped and asked if she was ok and she said she couldn\u2019t find her mom. So I asked her if she could take me to her house and I would try and help her. We get to her house and walk in and the mom is there dead. I brought the girl outside and called 911 and they asked me if I could do CPR and I said no she\u2019s cold and has no pulse. It was a really horrible scene to see. The police got there quickly and I stayed with the girl for a bit. Neighbours started coming up who knew the girl and talked with her. I left to get the girl some snacks and some of my daughters clothes as they were the same age and she was in filthy pj\u2019s and hadn\u2019t eaten all day. The girl said her mom was like that when she woke up so she had been in the house with her dead mother for like 5-6 hours, it was just awful. I left when children\u2019s aid showed up and went and get a few toys for the girl. She was very happy with them when I brought them for her.

Later my grandma asked me, \n\n\u201cWell you had to know he\u2019d do that, right?\u201d\n\nAfter he got into the bedroom he immediately started to belittle me and yell at me, I asked him to please go away.

You can\u2019t do shit.\u201d\n\nTo try and get past him while he stood in the doorway I tried to shove past him but he shoved me back then he punched out the lamp in our sons room and glass went everywhere around our son. I started sobbing while he stomped off\u2014 I heard banging noises and saw he had punched a huge hole in the wall by our front door.\n\nWhat eventually led me to calling the cops was when I was trying to leave for the night and he scooped up our son and told me I wasn\u2019t taking him anywhere.

They shouldn't, but that won't stop them.** And yes, sometimes, those kids are gay or bi. I had classmates in middle school who talked about doing it with friends, sometimes casually and sometimes because they actually wanted to date the person.\n\nAll that matters is that OP's son is being safe and responsible. That includes using protection, cleaning up any messes, and being respectful of anyone else in the house (in this case, the parents). Again, kids this age really shouldn't be sexually active, but if they're *going* to be then they need to understand the weight of their actions, how consent works (it should be enthusiastic and nothing less), how STDs/STIs are transmitted, etc.\n\nOP, it sounds like you have plans to let your partner have the talk with your son. That's good! Sex education in most schools is absolutely terrible (mine was just graphic pictures of infected genetalia and fear-mongering, no discussion at all of sexuality or LGBTQ+ identities). As a queer person myself, I hope more parents out there can handle these situations with patience, kindness, and love.\n\nYour son may be discovering sex a bit earlier than you or your husband expected, but as long as you guys help him understand the risks involved he'll have a much higher chance at a safe, healthy relationship with sex down the road.

{"prompt": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cd9tqr/im20_accidentally_befriended_a_12_year_old_girl/)\n\nI apologize if updates aren't allowed, I messaged the mods and got no response so I'm just going to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.\n\nSome helpful people suggested I contact my local version of the Big Brother program, and they were happy to help me out getting everything official and less sketchy, although they needed her guardian's permission first. On my part I needed to get a background check from the police.\n\nI sat down with her and explained what I was planning, and she seemed excited. I was a bit worried about what would happen when I asked to contact her parents as previous attempts had not been successful, but she gave me their phone number, and we got to chatting about the fun things we could do outside of just playing tennis.\n\nI gave her mother a call the next day and explained who I was, how I knew her daughter and why I thought it would be a good idea for me to become her Big Brother. Her mother seemed very weirded out, understandably, but over all pretty nice. We agreed that I would drive her home the next time we played tennis so we could meet in person.\n\nThe day came and after kicking her ass (my forehand is mint boi), we hopped in the car and headed to her place. Her mother was just as I imagined from speaking on the phone, a completely normal human being. Her father however was a different story. If I say he was creepy it implies something sexual, but I don't mean creepy in that way. He had almost no emotions, he smiled when he first saw me, but it was not a normal smile. If I said something funny and he would laugh, but it was like a robot might laugh. Very fucking bizarre dude, just something off about him. Overall though I thought our meeting went well, they just asked that I wait until I got my background check before I did anything other than play tennis with her which is super reasonable and I'm actually glad they weren't willing to sign their kid up to some strange dude without it.\n\nI went home and was super happy with how everything went. I was a tad worried her house was going to be some shit-hole and her parents were going to be druggies, but my fears were thankfully unfounded. A few days went past, and I was chillin', when I got a knock on the door. I open it and 3 cops are standing there looking too happy to see me. They ask me to come down to the station for an interview about the girl, although they tell me I'm not being arrested and it is voluntary. I may come across as naive in my last post, but even I can see that I need a fucking lawyer, so I tell them I'll meet with them when the time suits me.\n\nAfter frantically Googling around for a lawyer, I find one who seems to be competent. He rings the police station and asks what they want to interview me about, but they are tight-lipped and only let on that it's about me hanging out with the kid. I speak to my lawyer for a bit and despite his hesitation, I agree to meet with the police and try and explain whats going on. I bring with me as much evidence as I can, my call logs to child services (surprisingly difficult to request that where I live annoyingly), my correspondences with the Big Brother people, I even printed off my Reddit post. Anything to make me look like the upstanding person I am.\n\nThe interview was nice, when I started laying out evidence of my good-intent they were surprisingly accepting of it. The fact that I had made multiple calls to child services went a long way to convincing them I meant no harm. There were a couple of things that irked me though, and I don't know if they will ever stop irking me. I overheard the police multiple times say \"he's not the guy\". The way they said it implied they were still looking for someone after me. The next thing that irked me was one of the officers told me that the reason he didn't think it was me was because \"when she texted you and said her boobs were sore, you didn't engage.\" I've read through our text messages 3 times now looking for anything vaguely similar to that sentiment and I'm coming up with zip. I mean, I know nothing would turn up because I have never talked to a kid about their boobs in my life, but still I've triple checked.\n\nI've thought it over and over in my mind, and the only conclusion I can make is that I was not the only man she was interacting with. I can't think of anything else. Why else would the police imply they'll keep looking for someone after clearing me? And then to bring up a conversation that never happened? He must've confused my convos with someone else's. At least if she has been interacting with other people in inappropriate ways the police are involved and they can catch the guy, but sure as shit I'm not speaking to her ever again.\n\nThank you to everyone for their advice, it definitely was inappropriate of me to be hanging out with her alone and I'm glad you guys told me so. My background check came in the mail today and so I think I will still go ahead with signing up with the Big Brother program, but it will be with a random kid and more importantly with their parents permission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: My lawyer was with me for the police interview, he just thought it was a bad idea. What does he know though, pfft I've seen Better Call Saul Season 1, I know all about the law.", "completion": "Sounds like the parents checked their daughters mobile phone, after talking to you. Seems like you were not the only person she talked to and cops/parents confused you with the other guy. I hope everything turns out right for her, without harm.

{"prompt": "When I was 15 my dad got a girlfriend, my parents were divorced for 2 months at this point, and I was told she would be moving in in about 2 weeks. Not even 24 hours later I was told she, her 2 kids, and her dog would be moving in in 3 days because she got kicked out of her apartment. \n\nI decided I would still live with my dad because I thought it would be kind of cool to have another person to share clothes with (teenage girl thinking)\n\nMy dad and I were two peas in a pod, we were best friends, we would do everything together. Shopping were thursday\u2019s, homemade pizzas were saturday\u2019s, waffles were sunday\u2019s, and movies were monday\u2019s. \n\nI asked him to go see a new movie with me because it seemed so cool, we\u2019d watch horror movies all the time together. Who did he take, the day it came out, without telling me about it? My stepfamily. It really hurt. \n\nFast forward to that christmas, I got a T-shirt from walmart as a gift from my dad. My stepmom got a new car and a new phone. My stepsister got a new phone and a bunch of new clothes from adidas, tommy hilfiger, and guess. My stepbrother got a new phone and 2 pairs of Jordan\u2019s. The dog got a bunch of toys, a new bed and a new collar. I got less than the dog. \n\nI got a gift from my grandma of victoria\u2019s secret/pink clothes, and a $200 visa gift card. I was so excited the next day to grab my gift card and use it on something I found online. I couldn\u2019t find the box. The box with all of the VS/PINK and the gift card were gone. \n\nLong story short I ended up finding it in my stepsisters room. I told my dad that she took my gift from my grandma (it was over $300 worth of stuff, I wasn\u2019t going to not say anything) and I was hit with, \u201cwell why were you in her room? you shouldn\u2019t have been in there. why would she take it? I don\u2019t think she would do that.\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, my dad and all of my stepfamily was immediately against me and were all talking shit. Apparently the next day my stepsister had money go missing from her room, who does she instantly go to blame? Me. \n\nMy dad kicked me out, I never got my gifts from my grandma back, she passed away not even 6 months later. Those were my last presents from her, and I never got to enjoy them or say thank you because I was so upset about the situation. \n\nMy stepsister ended up finding her money a week later after it got washed in the laundry machine. My dad called me and apologized after he realized I was right about everything, I didn\u2019t talk to him for almost 2 years after that. We eventually picked up contact again, but it\u2019s genuinely just not the same. He\u2019s a completely different person, mentally, physically and emotionally. We see each other maybe once every 3 months, when we would spend every day together. He was my best friend, and now I can\u2019t even recognize him anymore. \n\nIf you still have your dad, or your parents, and you are on good terms please give them a big hug and tell them how grateful you are for them. I wish I told my dad I was grateful for the relationship we had before it got destroyed by my stepfamily. I dont think I can forgive my dad for choosing people he was with for 6 months, vs his daughter for 15 years at that point. I want to forgive him, but it was such a traumatic experience. Please help me mend my relationship with him. How do I forgive him? How do I bring it back up 5 years later that it really hurt me? I\u2019m scared it will bring back all the emotions we all had back then. \n\nTLDR: Stepfamily turned dad against me, took my best friend away from me, blamed me for taking stuff when it was actually the other way around, dad took their side, realized they were wrong a week later, didn\u2019t talk to him for 2 years, started talking again but he\u2019s a completely different person.

{"prompt": "I had Pita for 11 years. She was with me through moves, boyfriends, jobs, you name it\u2014and was perfect.  She never barked or bit. Her barks were like little chirps. My road trip buddy. She was house trained, and just the sweetest, most pure soul. She wanted love and to lick you constantly. Her little butt wiggles and standing on two legs reaching for me. Her army crawls in bed. She was PERFECT, and my whole WORLD. I loved her deeply and spoiled her. Gave her so much love. Carried her everywhere (6lb Chihuahua). Our family vet adored her and also gave her so much love.  Oh and her snores made me smile every night before I fell asleep! She LOVED me and adored me unconditionally, every single day of her life.\n\nPita was diagnosed with a stage 3-4 heart murmur two months ago. There were no other symptoms. She was still happy and lovey, and the vet thought with treatment, Pita would be okay. \n\nYesterday at 5am, Pita was breathing fast and labored, while also sounding like she was choking. We rushed her to the er vet who put her on oxygen. By 8am, we were informed by the vet that Pita was critical. She had begun bleeding and foaming at the mouth and the vet heard loud crackling in her lungs. I was shocked. I looked at my husband in disbelief. Almost stupid. This was so sudden. She was fine the night before, we had bed snuggles! I asked what we have to do to get her well. My husband had already realized what this meant. The er vet was \u201cclosed\u201d by that point, but said he would remain open for us to decide. The dr gave us the option of transporting her across the street to a different vet (as she wouldn\u2019t have made the 30 min trip to our family vet), or to put her down. Her organs were all rapidly failing. I called my family vet and had our dr talk to the er dr. When I took my phone back, she was kind but honest\u2014it wasn\u2019t looking good. Late stages of congestive heart failure! But I wanted to fight for her!! My husband and I asked to see her\u2014and when we did, we knew it was time to do right by her. And we did. Before she went to sleep, she made one more attempt to army crawl to me for kisses\u2014and that killed me. We stayed with her talking and petting her until the end. \n\nMy problem now (besides obviously losing the best pup ever), is that I not only feel lost, and heart achingly sad\u2014I feel an immense amount of guilt. The last moment I had her, I handed her to stranger and she didn\u2019t want to let go. I gave her to the nurse to help her\u2014but I thought wholeheartedly that I would get her back. I think about the times I left her while I was at work. How I told her to hush sometimes when she would chirp chirp chirp. How I didn\u2019t let her feel the sun one last time. How I didn\u2019t put her on the bed every single night, just some nights. What if there was a chance and I didn\u2019t make the right call?? What if I killed my dog needlessly?? I have so many regrets. And it\u2019s hurting as much as the pain. \n\nMy husband and our family vet said she had the best life. She was spoiled rotten and knew how much she was loved every second of the day. That her spirit is still with me but I DONT FEEL IT! \n\nI love animals and have several other rescues and a cat, but I don\u2019t know if I should get another. Would Pita be upset? Think I\u2019ve replaced her and she didn\u2019t matter? How do I get over this absolute pain? And the guilt? I\u2019ve been crying for 30 hours straight. I miss her so badly.

Upon noticing the oddly weird taste I asked my friend to taste it as well and she agreed that there was definitely something in my milkshake. In all of honesty, it tasted very much like rum with a spike of alcohol. \n\nAfter debating continuously with my friend about the odd taste I requested for a new milkshake. Particularly, this time \u201cmint chocolate\u201d instead of the original \u201cchocolate\u201d flavor, since I assumed maybe it was the chocolate in the milkshake that triggered such a funky taste. Once the waiter arrives at our table, I explain to him how weird my chocolate milkshake tastes. His reaction to my complaint was quite amateur and he kept arguing with me . He even randomly blurted out how \u201cthere is nothing in that milkshake besides chocolate ice cream!\u201d. Definitely suspicious right ?!\n\nOkay fast forward moments later, he finally brings me my \u201cmint chocolate\u201d milkshake replacement. His behavior was slightly rude as he plonked the milkshake on our table and left, didn\u2019t even apologize or show some common courtesy/mannerisms. Okay, now I tried the new milkshake which tasted even more like rum/alcohol than the one before. My friend agreed as well and could taste the alcohol. Why in the world would he put alcohol in my milkshake?! My friend and I  look like we can pass as our late teens, hence this waiter didn\u2019t even know our age. By the way, I am 22 and she is 21. I\u2019m glad my friend was driving and that my taste buds were able to pick up on the excessive amount of alcohol that was in my milkshake. \n\nAfterwards, we asked the waiter for a to-go cup so that we could take the milkshake home and he began to shake and wouldn\u2019t answer. Prior to that he also kept looking at us from afar while we were eating. On an interesting side note, we also noticed how he switched from working up front to the bar area and back which raised further suspicion. \n\nEventually, he brought me a to-go cup and we went home and even our parents confirmed that there was rum/alcohol in my milkshake.

We had a house meeting last night (called by him) he was drunk and voicing his concerns - most of which had to do with the lease so I told him to contact our landlord if he had issues with the lease. Conversation went around in circles, he kept bringing up past things that had little to no relevance in our current situation. I have been actively trying to replace the 2 roomates in out house over the past month. He asked if I'd be okay with it just being me and him in the house and he would cover the rest. He is BY NO MEANS FINACIALLY ABLE TO DO SO SO RIGHT NOW and so I told him no for that exact reason - and also told him that I had no intention of living with just 1 other person that is why I am in this big house and trying to find roommates to fill these 2 empty rooms.

Here he is: [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/SvdcVeX)\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened:\n\nAfter three days of keeping Satan in the crate, I realized two things.\n\n1) That if I was kidnapped by a random guy coming into my house and brought to a new place, then kept in a cage 24/7, I wouldn\u2019t be too friendly either. And 2) that I can\u2019t keep a cat in a cage indefinitely and just hope the situation magically improves somehow. Besides, I\u2019m kind of tired of getting my hands fucked with every time I try to feed him.\n\nSo my wife (the fucking trooper, she) and I decided to make a big compromise and started sleeping in the living room, leaving the cat to be out of the cage completely in my room.\n\nThe first three days, he would either run under my bed or into my closet and stare at me with wide eyes while making low guttural noises.\n\nOn the fourth day, I decided I would start to talk to it (mainly out of frustration) and start explaining to Satan that although I get it, he needs to chill the fuck out. He seems incredibly confused by this.\n\nEventually this seemed to work, and despite still not wanting to be touched, he stopped growling at me and signaling an imminent attack. That day I learned that cats understand tone like dogs.\n\nThis talking to him continued throughout the week and drove Satan to come out of the closet or under the bed while I was in the room, but if I moved at all he\u2019d hiss and dart back to cover.\n\nEventually something changed at the start of the second week and Satan started to get on the bed while I was in the room, which lead into him getting on top of furniture while I was in the room.\n\nAll throughout the ordeal I\u2019m looking at cat body language videos to try and understand the animal. Also, I\u2019m the only one feeding him and trying to get him to be okay with me being around while he eats.\n\nSomehow, one day I go into the room and, seeing him on the bed, I decide to plop down next to him to see if he\u2019ll attack me. He mrrreeeeewwws lowly, but doesn\u2019t attack, I look away from him, lean back and stay there for a while, pretending like this is not a terrible inconvenience for either of us. Satan obliged me and played along.\n\nMoving into the third week, I can sit in the bed and lay next to Satan and he shows no signs of aggression, so I try my next move: Putting one of my extremities RIGHT NEXT to him.\n\nI do this many times a day, acting like it\u2019s not a big deal, and eventually while laying next to him, I touch him with my knee (I figured if he goes into attack mode, I\u2019d rather have the sweet protection of thick denim).\n\nSatan immediately protests but doesn\u2019t move away, so mid week I try to touch him with my arm and to my surprise he\u2019s okay with that too.\n\nBy this point I\u2019ve also made a habit of cleaning his box and opening the blinds for him in the morning so he\u2019ll be able to look out the window. I slow blink before leaving to work and he slow blinks back.\n\nBefore I knew it, it was the fourth week and Satan\u2019s letting me pet him for short periods of time and only certain parts of his back, before hissing or lightly swatting (as opposed to the vicious war crimes he was trying to pull off initially).\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the fourth week and at this point, we\u2019ve built enough of a tacit communication that I feel comfortable fully petting him, talking to him, and letting him walk around the house while my dog\u2019s out on a walk.\n\nAt this point, I come in the room every day in the morning to change and talk to Satan, and he talks back and DEMANDS to be petted by me. On my off days, I go in the room and he\u2019ll follow me around.\n\nBy the end of the fourth week, I play with Satan and he lets me pick him up. I finally realize he was actually a very sweet, super scared kitty that needed to feel safe and be given space, and furthermore everything negative that happened was my fault for not understanding him and pressuring him.\n\nBy then, I already feel he\u2019s social enough that I can offer him around, but just for good measure I keep him for one more (fifth) week (which was enough for me to bond with him and feel bad about giving him away).\n\nMy wife and I discuss whether or not to keep him, but my dog (who\u2019s named after a Mexican narco, but that\u2019s a different story) ends up going after a cat when we\u2019re walking him (it was dark) and getting hurt, which ends that line of thinking.\n\nThe week went by smoothly, and I manage to get his medical records from my friend\u2019s family and the hospital Satan was taken to.\n\nSixth week, I take to Facebook and, with due disclaimers, I offer him around:\n\n>Satan, older cat, needs a new home\n\n>Former cat of a loner\n\n>Affectionate but needs house without children or other pets\n\n>Is curious and playful once it gets comfortable\n\nA lot of people offer to take Satan into their homes, and a lot of people don\u2019t meet the requirements I outlined.\n\nEventually someone reaches out to me and not only are they a perfect fit for him, they understand all the constraints that go into adapting an older cat into a new home. They came yesterday and I didn\u2019t even struggle to get him into the carrier they brought.\n\nI went into their home today to take some of Satan\u2019s playthings as well as some food I had left over, and although he was hiding under the bed and mrrrewing, he peeked out on the halfway while my wife and I talked to his new owners.\n\nI stressed to these people that if they have any big issues with him he\u2019s 100% returnable, but (unlike me) this isn\u2019t their first adopted cat. We promised to keep in touch, and I came back and cleaned up my room to sleep in it.\n\nOne of my knuckles is fucked forever, and I will absolutely never have a cat ever again, but it was a great experience nonetheless.\n\nThe fucking end (I hope).", "completion": "Thank you for not releasing Satan into the wild!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd tell your wife a stranger on reddit finds her precious for coping with it all!"}

{"prompt": "So about an hour and a half ago, I was asleep, and I heard my door open, and a girl walked in and got in bed with me, pulled the blanket over themselves, and passed out. I didn\u2019t think much of it, because I have a friend who will occasionally just climb into my bed if she was out drinking with my roommates or whatever, so I just assumed it was her. \nI fell asleep for a bit, then woke up again and I could see this girls back, and she had a tattoo that I knew my friend didn\u2019t have.

She was drunk, and I think she just got turned around in our house and ended up in the wrong room since she didn\u2019t know the place very well. In any case, this girl turned out not to be a complete stranger, there were no sexual assault implications, and everything turned out fine, if a little bit awkward for everyone involved. \nAnd to clarify for those wondering, I live in a rented house in a college town, not a dorm, and we always make sure to lock up the house at night, which is why I assumed at first that she was my friend, let in by one of my roommates, and why I was extra confused when it turned out it wasn\u2019t her lol.", "completion": "You dont want someone with no recollection of the events to wake up naked in a strangers bed hours later.

It\u2019s bullshit that you can\u2019t get pregnant with PCOS. You can\u2019t get pregnant with your hormones out of whack and unbalanced but you can get pregnant. \n\nMany of those same hormonal issues also play a role in endometriosis. \n\nYour doctor was wrong, as many of them are about women\u2019s health and endocrine disease. Even the ob/gyns and endocrinologists. \n\nIf you balance your hormones (diet and supplements and meds) you can certainly get pregnant. Lots of that going on in r/pcos and r/TTC_PCOS and I\u2019m sure there are endometriosis ones too. \n\nI have PCOS and I ovulate and bleed every 38-45 days. I\u2019ve used supplements to shorten that from 60-90. \n\nI have no reason to believe that I won\u2019t be able to get pregnant when I\u2019m ready. But I\u2019ve also been on the balancing hormone track for a long time so I know what works and what I need to do. \n\nLupus is another story but low dose naltrexone can work wonders for autoimmune disorders. At 50mg naltrexone is used for opioid withdraws. At 4.5mg it acts almost in the opposite way. It down regulates your opioid receptors for 3-4 hours and then causes an endorphin spike that causes your body to kick up its anti-inflammatory response. \n\nIt can be a miracle for people with lupus. I broke my back when I was 24 and it\u2019s been a miracle for pain relief for me. It\u2019s also not only safe while pregnant, it\u2019s encouraged because of its anti-inflammatory nature. \n\nMore at r/lowdosenaltrexone \n\n\nSo all that to be said.....you most likely can get pregnant again. You can also do IVF. You could also bank your eggs and have a surrogate. And of course you can always adopt and foster. \n\n\nMake the choice that\u2019s best for you right now without assuming you can\u2019t ever get pregnant again. \n\nIt sounds like that\u2019s an abortion. \n\nIf you want to be a mom, I\u2019m 100% sure that universe can figure out how to make that happen for you in a way that satisfies your heart. \n\nMessage me if you want to talk privately. I\u2019m happy to chat. \n\nMuch love to you."}

I was in a relationship with a person a between mid 2018 and mid 2019 and during the beginning everything was okay and quite beautiful but I knew that he had issues. I had my own issues as well but I had it under control as I was social and had lots of friends but then he wanted me to not get drunk or party or meet my friends. I couldn't dress the way I wanted to or wear make up. Talking about feminism was a no go. Watching Captain Marvel and hearing him say every two seconds that what Cap did wasn't natural for a woman, after so many months of being told that women this and women that, led me to break my own laptop in front of him. I was called abusive. I was suicidal. I felt alone. I didn't have anyone. I was isolated when I became his and he told me he wanted me to be his and I knew that his behavior was not okay but I thought I could have changed him.\n\nI know I was suicidal and as a result I caused him so much pain as a result but it was only because I had no contact with people anymore. I felt horrible. I could meet a guy friend but with another girl by my side, that's how he'd wanted it. Anyway he broke up with me because apparently he gave me enough time to change my views and I just didn't do it.\n\nI have never been the same again. I promised to myself that I would never allow anyone to hurt me as much as he did. I am no longer suicidal but this week hit me differently. Normally, I think of myself as a \"bad bitch\", it's a joke, but I am insecure and I own up to it because I know I have issues due to my childhood and the problems that my family caused me. I will get therapy, that is a promise. I can't right now because I moved into another country. But I am not the same person anymore since that relationship. I have a lot of internalized misogyny and I hate being a woman because I feel that as a woman I cannot contribute in any way to society despite that not being true and having so many role models. I feel like a failure. I want to be so strong and able to be good enough that... I can't. My boyfriend is my source of warm support and love and he is truly healthy.

{"prompt": "So my gf adopted this young outdoor cat who was always hanging on our porch a couple months ago. The cat is maybe a year old now and had been hanging out in this area since he was a kitten. When she went to get his shots done and a check up from the vet, the doc informed her that he had butthole damage. He had some sort of scarring on his butthole and we joked that he was a rape victim, but assumed it was most likely from doing something stupid outside or getting into a fight with another animal. He hangs out mostly inside but when he does go out he will sometimes come back with a red and inflamed butthole. We continued to brush it off. \n\nTwo days ago he was outside and we saw him walking around the side of our house. My gf, roommate, and I were watching him through the window when our old creepy nextdoor neighbor came out and started calling the cat over to him. The cat came up to him and he started to pet the cat a little bit then proceeded to pick him up and walk around behind a bush out of our sight. He was taller than the bush and had crouched down so we couldn\u2019t see either of them at all behind it. Maybe 2 min later the old man emerges and cat out of sight. Old man glances at us and walks inside. Our cat comes back about an hour later and you wouldn\u2019t believe it but his butthole was bright red and inflamed... That obviously looks suspect as hell right?? We haven\u2019t let him outside since that as we are worried about his well being. And there really isn\u2019t anything we could do about even if we knew he was being molested by our neighbor. Any advice on what we should do and if you think he is getting molested? Any cat butthole experts know what else it could be?\nWe are all kinda worried and got a bit of sick feeling in our stomachs from the whole thing..\n\nIs the old man molesting him or are we overreacting?\n\nAlso side note- this cat does not have a single care in the world, u could step on him and he\u2019ll just lay there and accept it. If any cat were to be a rape victim cat it would be this one.\n\nEdit: any jokes i have made are not to be taken seriously. just tryna make a scary situation a little more easy to handle/process.

{"prompt": "Jess 23f and I have been together for two years and she never liked my mom and with good reason because my mom is an alcoholic. My sister was placed into my care not too long ago. If I had not taken her, she would have been placed in the system. Jess never liked the idea and if I did not know any better, I would say that she was disappointed when I made the decision.\n\nShe wants us to have a baby and has been very vocal about it especially since my sister moved in. I am not particularly ready because I have a lot of responsibilities so it does not seem possible at the moment. I am juggling work and college on top of taking care of my sister. Jess still does not seem to understand that but I brushed it off as normal relationship differences.\n\nLast night I worked night shift and this morning, my sister was not herself at all. I took her out for ice cream and  tried getting her to talk and she eventually tearfully told me that she knows that I don't want her here. I asked her what gave her that idea and she explained to me that my fiance was telling her that we will soon have a baby of our own and start our own real family because that is what adults do. \n\nThere wouldn't be enough space for her because her room is supposed to be the baby's nursery so she might have to be taken back to my mom. I was so livid for many reasons but I tried not to show my sister. My mom was a functioning  alcoholic but got worse a while after I left home. Maybe because I took care of everything and everyone so now she had to be an actual parent. Anyway she would leave my sister alone for a day or two to go see her boyfriend. My sister would eventually have to call me and tell me the truth once the food ran out so I would have to drop everything and go down there. She generally tried to hide my mom's bad parenting.\n\nShe told  me the day I took her was the happiest day of her life and I have a very pink thank you bracelet to prove it. So it made me very mad to hear that Jess told her that she would go back. I explained to her that I want her here and nothing would ever change that. She has nothing to worry about and that Jess did not mean anything she said. She is not usually mean so it's so confusing for me.\n\nMy sister normally worships the ground Jess walks on but has been avoiding her today. I asked Jess about it and she did not deny. She said that my sister is not our responsibility and that she is ruining our plans to start a real family. I told her that my sister is in fact my responsibility and real family. I have no intentions of having a baby with her or get married if she can't respect that.\n\nShe freaked out and started shouting and calling my sister names saying it's all her fault. My sister must have heard because it's a tiny apartment. Because of this, I told her that she needs to leave my place and go calm down. We were planning on eloping but it's definitely off the books now.\n\nDid I make the right decision? And how do I reassure my sister especially after she heard what Jess said about her?", "completion": "You care for your sister by removing Jess from both of your lives so that it's clear your sister can always rely on you.

I asked if she wanted to keep the car and she says no, she\u2019ll buy one when she gets over there. So far so good.

{"prompt": "I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.\n\nI was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.\n\nEventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.\n\nFast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.\n\nThis is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.\n\nI just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of \"what are you waiting for\" and \"how could you even think  about it\". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?", "completion": "Is it just me or is it more fucked up that a girl is gonna lose someone who could be a good role model because society finds it weird for a guy to take an interest in a child.\n\nI get your reservations, maybe you should ask her to introduce you to her parents and let them decide what's appropriate.

They\u2019re still sort of friends, so when they\u2019re both feeling lonely my dad goes over and they may have a meal together which is nice, but my mum\u2019s quite rude to him and treats him like a slave to do all her gardening etc. We both took off back to boarding today, so my dad dropped us at mum\u2019s for her to take us back to school.

They listen when think we can't do this anymore and call when we skip chemo because \"fuck it, why bother.\" They then welcome us back with no judgement when we decide to give chemo another shot. \n\nAs a cancer patient I may not know every nurse I've dealt with, but know that I love them all, and so should you.\n\n\n*Edit 2* Thank you to everyone who has responded, I never thought this many people would give a shit. I checked into donating my body, being a fatty is a big no-no apparently, also the numerous surgeries I've had (not cancer related, I've got a bad habit of doing stupid shit throughout my life) and the chemical scarring from my previous careers means they don't want this well used husk. Their loss I suppose. Keep being awesome, and if y'all ever need to talk to someone who has done this cancer dance for some time, just hit me up. I'll be happy to, well I mean for as long as I've got left lulz. Please don't contact me by Ouija board, that would be creepy, I don't think I'd be a cute ghost.", "completion": "Have you looked into body donation? Personally that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do when I die. I\u2019m not sure what the requirements are, if there are any, but I know the medical school near me pays for the burial/cremation costs as a thank you. Maybe that would be a way to reduce the burden on your family?"}
{"prompt": "TLDR: my cousin cyber stalked my female cousin, sister, and my sisters boyfriend. Tried to use me as a pawn to get to them. Crashed my baby shower knowing the would be there. And a whole mess of drama in between!\n\nHey all! Honestly, I feel like a huge asshole today. I am totally prepared to hear it, but I just need to hear a new perspective on the situation. This post will be pretty long because there is 4 years of history here. I apologize for any grammar mistakes ahead of time, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and am totally scatterbrained! Also apologizing in advance if the formatting is weird, I\u2019m on mobile!\n\n\n\n\nSo I have a special needs cousin who is a few years younger than me. Let\u2019s call him Randy. We aren\u2019t blood related, he is my moms step brothers son. But we spent a good amount of time together growing up, and never saw him as less of a family member. My family moved out of state when I was 11, and that created some drama within our extended family. So I really haven\u2019t spent much time with him face to face since we were kids.\n\n\nHis parents like taking turns between ignoring he has problems, and thinking his problems are way worse than they are. Which always frustrated me, because he never seemed to get the care he needed growing up. Considering that, he is pretty high functioning. He graduated high school, he worked at Walmart for a few years, and is now working at a high school cafeteria. He\u2019s really good at video games and played guitar in a band. He seemed to be doing well after high school.\n\n\nBut several years ago his social crew probably fell apart, like most do after high school. And all he did was sit on his computer on social media for hours a day. Trying to connect and feel social with anyone. His parents didn\u2019t do anything to enrich his life. They have always had marriage problems and always let those problems take priority over Randy. I truly believe he was neglected for most of his life, and especially his adult life. And that breaks my heart for him. I was probably one of the only people that talked to him on a semi consistent basis.\n\n\nFast forward to 2017. I\u2019m getting married. Our family drama has been squashed and this is the first wedding of the generation for the family. I\u2019m not one for big weddings, so we found a nice chapel in Vegas and had a fun reception dinner. Luckily we all live in the Southwest so everyone was able to attend, including Randy and his family. It was honestly a great time! \n\n\nBut this is when Randy reconnected with another cousin of ours. Let\u2019s call her Tara. Tara is closer to Randys age, and they definitely spent more time together growing up.\n\n\nAnyway, our honeymoon is when things started to escalate with Randy. He finally got to meet my husband, really liked him, and somehow got his phone number. At first I thought it was really sweet. But then the text messages started. Almost constantly wanting to talk. We both got multiple messages a day. Including \u2018hello?\u2019 messages when we didn\u2019t reply fast enough. Eventually we had to tell him we are on vacation, trying to enjoy our time together and that we will call him when we got home. I thought he was just excited to see everyone from the wedding, and excited to meet now family members. But this was a warning of what was to come.\n\n\nWhen we returned home from our honeymoon, things with Randy settled down for a while and our relationship was normal. But that was not the case for my cousin Tara.\n\n\nApparently since reconnecting at the wedding he started contacting her constantly. Constantly texting, calling her multiple times a day, and messaging her on all her social media platforms. It really freaked her out. It escalated to her receiving messages like \u2018I can\u2019t wait to hear your voice again\u2019 and \u2018you are so beautiful I can\u2019t wait to see you again\u2019 and other things that would be inappropriate to hear from your cousin. When she wouldn\u2019t reply he would hound her will \u2018hello? I can see you saw my messages\u2019 and things like that. She was extremely uncomfortable, and ended up blocking him. That\u2019s when he started reaching out to the rest of the family.\n\n\nMyself, my mom, dad, sister, brother, another cousin, Taras mom, my grandparents, my husband, my NEW MIL AND FIL, and ALL HER FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK (Like he literally went down the list) received messages from Randy asking about Tara and why she won\u2019t talk to him anymore. I was the one of the only people to give it to him straight, and I told him he made her uncomfortable and what he did to make her feel that way. Because I don\u2019t think he understood those kind of boundaries. But he didn\u2019t stop.\n\n\nAt this point my Aunt, Taras mom, confronted Randy\u2019s parents about his behavior. Because he crossed a line. And it BLEW UP. I mean full on family feud. Randy\u2019s parents refused to believe he did anything wrong, refused to even talk to him about it. It definitely divided the family, most siding with Tara and my Aunt.\n\n\nOver the next few weeks more and more of my family ends up blocking him. And Randy realized I\u2019m one of the few family members that still responds to him. But it\u2019s always about Tara. I guess she had to change her number because of all of this. He was asking me to give him her number daily, asking me to message her for him, asking me to call her, asking me for my little sisters number so he can ask her about Tara. I remember after a long shift at work I had 16 texts from him about Tara, including \u2018hello??\u2019 and \u2018have you read my message yet?\u2019\n\n\nSomehow he then got my sisters phone number and was doing the same thing to her.\n\n\nIt got so bad that my husband had to tell him to stop, and that really upset Randy. We end up taking on the phone for 3 hours one night because I was DONE. I told him he was acting inappropriately, that what he was doing was harassment. I had to teach him what harassment was essentially. I told him that he couldn\u2019t use me to relay information to anyone else, and that I would never give him anyone\u2019s phone number. \n\n\nAt this point I was really starting to feel used and manipulated. He never even asked how I was doing, he didn\u2019t care about anything going on in my life. I was all Tara. Have you heard from Tara today? Did you get her new number? Hello??? Did she respond to you? Have you texted her yet? I was just so fed up. I told him I was not going to discus anyone in our family at all. If he wanted to chat it was going to be about his life and my life only. At the end of the conversation he seemed to get it. He apologized and agreed we\u2019d only discuss what was going on in our lives.\n\n\nWell I didn\u2019t hear from Randy for about 6 months after that. Until his attention turned to my sister, let\u2019s call her Annie. Annie and I are close in the way you can go three months without talking, then pick up exactly where we left off. We get along great and I love my sister. But we are not involved in our day to day lives and at this point lived in different cities.\n\n\nHe started texting me constantly about my sister. Asking me to ask her to unblock him. Asking about her work schedule. Asking me to give him her number. Asking about her friends and wanting their phone numbers. I squash this pretty quickly and tell him to stop. And he does, for a few months he goes quiet and we don\u2019t hear from him other than holiday wishes.\n\n\nNow he wants us to watch him play his guitar. Ok cool sure. But he wants me to FaceTime him WITH my sister. I offer to watch him just me and my husband. No. Annie has to watch too. And this one goes on for MONTHS. At this point I\u2019m so tired of trying to explain why she won\u2019t talk him, tired of explaining why him hounding us is was wrong, so I ended up being more blunt with him. I told him Annie is creeped out and doesn\u2019t want to talk to him. I tell him this, he wants to apologize, he wants her number, I refuse.\n\n\nHe stops talking to me for another 6 months.\n\n\nBut now Annie has a boyfriend. Somehow Randy finds out and is now obsessed with her boyfriend, we\u2019ll call him Tanner. \n\n\nAt this point Randy figures he needs to warm me up a bit to talk to me. I finally get a \u2018hi how are you?\u2019 before he asks me to give him Tanners number, I refuse (I also don\u2019t actually have his number) and tell him to stop asking me for other peoples information because I won\u2019t give it to him. So instead, Randy messaged ALL of Tanners family members on Facebook trying to get information on him. I\u2019m talking parents, grandparents, and cousins. They all ignore him because Annie gave them a heads up. But I still thinks it\u2019s ridiculous that he goes so far to contact someone. And I truly don\u2019t know what his intentions are.\n\n\nFast forward to Christmas 2020. Randy has been quiet, but we still exchange holiday wishes, and check in once and a while. Anyway on Christmas I am talking with our grandmother. She tells me that during the time he was obsessed with my cousin Tara, he was also harassing another girl he went to high school with. Same thing. Messaging ALL of he Facebook friends, reaching out to her parents and aunts and uncles. Messaging her all all platforms. It gets so bad she had to call the cops on him! My grandma also \u2018gave me permission\u2019 to block him completely because I guess literally everyone else in our family has. She says Tara is terrified to see him and refuses to go to family events because she is AFRAID HE WILL ASSULT HER IF HE GETS THE CHANCE. And I feel just so gross about all of it. On one hand I am completely disgusted with his behavior and totally want to cut ties too. But on the other, I feel so incredibly bad for him. How lonely he must be, and that I\u2019ve really been the only person in our family to communicate with him for years. I\u2019m sympathetic to his problems, and still like to think of him as my cute little cousin. He really wasn\u2019t talking to me at that time, so I didn\u2019t end up blocking him.\n\nBut at this point I\u2019m also furious because what are his parents doing? Why aren\u2019t they involved? How are they completely ignorant to the situation? They have been made aware plenty of times, by plenty of people, but they choose to do nothing.\n\n\nFast forward to February 2021. I\u2019m pregnant and I\u2019m having a virtual shower for the family. It\u2019s a big deal because this is the first baby in our family in 15 years! My wonderful MIL planned it and sent out cute party boxes for those that RSVPd. Including Randy\u2019s mom. \n\n\nFive days before the shower, Randy messages my MIL. \n\u2018I saw you sent something to my mom, what is it?\u2019\n\u2018Oh it\u2019s just some party favors for Dragonites baby shower\u2019\n\u2018Am I invited?\u2019\n\nMy MIL knows all the history and tells him no, it\u2019s just for the women of the family. In reality I don\u2019t really care for too much gendered stuff like that, and there were men who were invited, as well as Tara and my sister Annie. But I was not going to have my invited guests feel uncomfortable because of Randy. Even if it was virtual.\n\n\nHe then messages me separately. Asking if he can play a song for everyone. I tell him no. He asks if he can sign on for just a minute. I tell him no. He tries to guilt trip me by saying things like \u2018I just want to see my family again.\u2019 And I shut that down. I told him straight up that I know he just wanted to see Tara and Annie, and that would make them uncomfortable and it was not an appropriate time to try and reconnect. I told him it was disrespectful to use my baby shower as a way to connect with people who did not want to see him. I really didn\u2019t want any drama, and I definitely didn\u2019t want Tara to have to see him. He was insistent that he wouldn\u2019t do anything inappropriate and just wanted to say hi. I told him that it wasn\u2019t the time or place for that, and respectfully asked him not to join the meeting with his mom. I even offered that we could maybe have a call separately with other family members another time. He agreed and said he wouldn\u2019t join the meeting.\n\n\nBut then he messages my MIL again, asking her in secret to allow him to be at the shower, allowing him to play a song. She said no and shut him down. But really? You are going to go behind my back like that? And bother my MIL? I was pissed!\n\n\nThen everyday leading up to my shower he is asking about a time and date to Zoom with Me, my husband, Annie and Tanner. The day of the shower I wake up to 3 messages about this zoom call with my sister. I tell him I\u2019m overwhelmed by shower things and that we\u2019d maybe plan it after a few days just to get him off my back. He agrees.\n\n\nMy shower goes off just fine, the games we planned were fun, and it was time to open presents. Then I hear Randy\u2019s voice! \u2018Hi everyone I just wanted to say hi and play you guys a song!\u2019 I was so pissed! You can tell my sister and cousin were super uncomfortable! Luckily my MIL is awesome and shut that down pretty quickly. And he left the call after only a minute or two. But I felt so angry. So...violated in a way. I told him my boundaries and he chose not to respect that after claiming he understood.\n\n\nNot even 5 minutes after the shower was over, he calls me. Why I picked up? I don\u2019t know. He asks me if anyone saw him say hello. Everyone did Randy. He asks me if anyone heard him playing his guitar in the other room. No Randy. He asks if the next day we can zoom with my sister and her boyfriend. I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know her schedule. I\u2019m so mad I get him off the phone quick. He messages me about it 4 more times that night about it. I ignored all of them.\n\n\nHe then texts my husband. He wants to know what he thinks about the conversation he and I had after the shower. My husband flat out said \u2018nobody heard you play guitar\u2019 and that was the end of that.\n\n\nRandy then messages my MIL at MIDNIGHT. He\u2019s upset. He thought it was supposed to be women only. He wants to know why he wasn\u2019t invited. She ignores him and wakes up to a bunch of ????\n\n\nAt this point my husband is PISSED and lays into him kind of hard about messaging me and his mom too much. Randy apologized and went silent for a few days.\n\n\nBut only for a few days until he wants to zoom with Annie and Tanner again. He wants me to set up the call and plan it. I tell him that he makes them super uncomfortable, and if he wants to zoom with them, then he is responsible for mending that relationship and planning it himself. I offer to zoom with him just me and my husband, but he refuses. He wants it to be with everyone, or not at all. Just another ploy to get to people that don\u2019t want to talk to him.\n\n\nOver the last few days he keeps texting me over and over again asking about this call. Telling me he can\u2019t get ahold at Annie and asking if I will talk to her. Asking me if I have heard from her yet. And I ignore him. I just can\u2019t think of the words to say to him anymore. Annie and I live in different states, she has a crazy work schedule. I can\u2019t force her to sit down and zoom call someone she doesn\u2019t not want to talk to.\n\n\nThis morning I woke up to the same 3 messages copy and pasted over an hour early in the morning. 20 minutes apart. And I just couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. I broke. I blocked him on my phone, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\n\nI just couldn\u2019t stand being used as a means of communication anymore. I\u2019ve been shutting it down for 4 years! He\u2019s never gotten any information out of me, but refuses to quit trying. He can\u2019t even try to have a normal relationship with me. I am so offended that he \u2018crashed\u2019 my baby shower, after agreeing he wouldn\u2019t. Harassing my MIL about it. And refusing to take no for an answer. I am just so completely done with this relationship. \n\n\nEven typing this right now I feel bad. I don\u2019t want our relationship to be like this. I don\u2019t want to be another family member that alienated him. But he clearly doesn\u2019t value our relationship as more than just a means of communication with others. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I just feel like a total asshole, but I\u2019m 35 weeks pregnant and don\u2019t need the stress!\n\n\n\nThank you to anyone who actually read this long ass post. I\u2019m sure this was more of a vent and cathartic outlet for me, but I\u2019d maybe like another perspective or advice on how to handle this situation moving forward.\n\nEdit: Wow I really didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the awards! Also thank you for the kind works and encouragement. I\u2019m definitely going NC and plan to stay that way. I\u2019m also going to look into how to notify the school he works for about his outside behavior. Just to clarify a few things. We do live in different states, and he has no idea where I live. His parents are COMPLETELY aware of what\u2019s going on, they choose to do nothing. And I absolutely stand by my sister and cousin. At times I felt like a shield for them, protecting them by shutting him down and telling him his actions were wrong. But sometimes it\u2019s hard to make the right decision and hurt someone. Especially when you are trying to make everyone happy.", "completion": "I feel like you waited entirely too long to block this guy.

Either that or he's going to go full on obsessed over the wrong person and wind up getting jumped.

Some people never learn basic respect and since his parents didn't bother teaching him appropriate social interactions he's paying the price now.\n\nI highly suggest you keep his mom and dad out of your life and business from now on since they can't keep him under control.

{"prompt": "To begin I am 17 years old my girlfriend is also 17. Recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about 2 weeks during that time I gave her one of my old phones so we could still communicate using snapchat. We have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. We both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. About 4 days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him. Today he asked her to text him what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. We checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the time when the phone wasn't in her position. There was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent. Her mom does not know and is away for the next 4 days in a foreign country. She is currently there alone with her stepdad. What should she do?\n\n\nUPDATE!!!.... She told her mom before she got back from said foreign country and her mom advised her to remain normal until she got back the next day. Her mom also made her stay at her grandma's house and when she got back she confronted her stepdad. Initially the stepdad denied it over and over but when her mom said she has proof he admitted to doing it and gave silly excuses why like saying \"he wanted to protect my gf\". My gf mom proceeded to kick him out and told him not to come back. He after hearing that he tried to stab himself with a screwdriver but her mom threatened to call the police and he left. It's been 2 days since that happened and he has continuously tried to guilt my gf mom and accused her of cheating soo he dosent look bad. Her mom is understandably devastated and completely confused (this was her Significant Other/husband for over 10+ years) and she has since sought therapy for advice on how to proceed.

I have been away at University for the past 3 years (back during semester breaks) so I haven't had the chance to witness all that was done over the years first hand. However, now with COVID-19 and social distancing I have spent a little more time at home than I would like to in this environment.\n\nAside from that, my mom decided it was necessary for him to pay rent each month for the upkeep of the house, especially since she does the shopping for groceries, and also has to pay for any of the maintenance done to the house. After that deal was implemented my brother has barely paid her and when he is confronted about it, he will get mad and say she's overbearing or asking of too much. Personally, I think it is very reasonable but that's just my two cents.\n\nWell today (about 30 minutes ago) she told him he had to move out and gave him a 30 day notice. After she told him, he went downstairs to the basement where he sleeps and started slamming a bunch of doors and cursing at my mom about how she is going to go to hell and the family hates her etc. etc. (we don't btw). But my concern is that with his bad temper and a 30 day window, I fear for my mom's safety. I am home all the time and I can fight my brother if need be, especially if he lays a finger on our mom but, I know that is not the best way to go about the situation. I texted my mom as soon as he started his episode that I should call the cops but she said no because \"he will get in trouble\". I told her to at least put her pride aside and lock her door as well as put something in front of it tonight just to be safe.\n\nI don't know when he's going to move out but this safety precaution damn sure can't go on every night, and I am not going to wait for things to escalate and my brother do physical harm to my mom. What should I do in this situation? Calling the cops would mean that something would need to happen but I don't want to be reactive I want to be proactive. Please help!\n\nEdit: I live in Maryland", "completion": "Ignore your mom.  The next time he goes on a rant session call them if you feel it\u2019s crossing the line.  If he\u2019s just screaming about blah blah then fine.  But if he gets physical it\u2019s a nope.  \n\nAlso, I would type out a notice.  Put the reasons being as not paying rent and damaging property.  If the police have to come you can show them the notice.  Make sure you put the day he needs to move out. \n\nOn that date, call the police.  They can come to ensure nothing happens and make sure he moves.  \n\nHe will get in trouble but it\u2019s his own fault.  No need to coddle someone who is this immature."}
{"prompt": "I've (19m) been with my girlfriend (19) for a year and a half now, and for the first time last week, she woke up screaming bloody murder. It was about 2:30 am. I turned over as I was trying to get comfortable, like I do when I'm trying to sleep every night, and it's like she heard it in her sleep and her body freaked out. She started to crawl over me like she was trying to escape the room and started screaming. Loudest I've ever heard her, and shes a loud person. Took like 5-10 seconds to get her sto stop. She started crying after, but not during - this was a pure, horrified scream, no sobbing between breathes. \n\nAfterwards, she was terrified. Of everything. She thought there was something under the bed, she had me check the whole room. She's scared of the dark, but it doesn't affect her when she sleeps. After this, for the rest of the night, she needed the TV on. We stayed up for a few hours, and I tried talking with her. It felt like every other thing I said scared the crap out of her, and caused her to cry. \n\nFor a few days after, she didn't scream, but she would wake up suddenly a few times, similar to when she screamed; only difference is, instead of a scream, she just breathed really heavily and fast and was scared. I would hold her and talk to her for a few minutes and she would calm back down. \n\nA good 5-6 days have gone by since the scream, and just an hour ago, about 6:30, she screamed again. She had her alarm go off for work at 6:00, and we were laying there, half asleep, for about 30-45 minutes before she needed to get up - pretty typical.. (I thought this was pretty funny, but still) I farted and it sent her off. It's not unusual for me to fart in bed when I'm half asleep, but for some reason this one scared her. She started screaming again. This one was reasonably shorter, 3-4 seconds maybe, and she didn't try crawling over me again. However, everything else was the same. She needed me to walk her to the bathroom, walk her to her car, and half of the things I said seemed to scare her. The weird part is it was perfectly light out, and she was just as scared.\n\nShe talks about how after this happens, she always feels like something's going to get her, usually from the shadows. She knows nothings there, but she can't will herself to not be scared. \n\nAny idea what this is, and any possible treatments for it? Or any ideas for how I can best prevent it / make her feel calm when it happens? She hasn't been diagnosed or treated, but she for sure suffers from some form of anxiety, and possibly minor PTSD from her rough childhood. \n\n(These screams are taking a toll on me and are starting to make me nervous to go to bed as well. It's like watching a movie and knowing theres going to be a jump scare) \n\nTL;DR my girlfriend has suddenly started walking up screaming, with no history of doing so.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the kind support! We have a doctors visit scheduled tomorrow to hopefully see what the matter is. We both suspect its night terrors. I'll update you guys after our visit. Thank you again!\n\nEdit 2: went to the doctor, shes going to be alright.

{"prompt": "\nI understand how bizarre this situation sounds, but I honestly have no idea where else to go, at this point.\n\nSome background: \nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for around 4 years. He is sweet and kind and extremely empathetic. Our families like each-other, and we had plans to get married before the pandemic. Just before march we decided to go on holiday abroad. Another couple joined us later. ( John= husband, Kelly =Wife) It was lovely and we spent most of the time hiking or swimming in the lake. I speak the local language so i did most of the talking. All 4 of us are complete urban legend and dark tourism enthusiasts, so we went into the city for a tour. I spent most of the time translating because the translator there was only half doing her job. The urban legends weren\u2019t really anything special, it was things we\u2019ve already read about so we decided to split from the group. Kelly and I saw a salon still open so we went to go check it out, whilst John and my boyfriend went to check out some old church and ruins (John\u2019s an archaeologist). \nAfter our nails had dried, kelly called John to see whats up, because she had something like 10 missed calls from him. We had our phones on silent. John was panicking and basically speaking gibberish. Kelly told him to slow down and finally managed to get that my boyfriend had fallen and now he\u2019s lost. We basically ran out of the salon and ran over to the church. John was in a panic and had called the local police of OUR hone country, instead of the country here, so i immediately dialled the local number and they told us that they\u2019d already been contacted and they were on their way. They then instructed us to remain where we were together. John was with Kelly in the woods, so i called them back, but it was pitch black and i fell apparently exactly where my boyfriend had fallen. I bashed my head against something, presumably a rock and im fairly sure I had a mild concussion since i was pretty disoriented from there on. The emergency services found my bf completely fine. Uninjured. A bit confused but thats it. We got driven back and John calmed down, but he was still more shaken than my boyfriend. We said goodnight to them and decided to take it easy the next day. My boyfriend slept for over 24 hours, and i got seriously concerned and checked a few times to make sure he was still alive. I briefly woke him up and made him drink water. He went straight back to sleep and woke up later. \n\nMain: \n\nI noticed something off immediately. As soon as he woke up his entire personality was just off. Like down to the tiniest things. His pattern of speech, his eye movements, his posture. I asked him repeatedly if he\u2019s feeling better. We went out for lunch and he called me Jarissa. This is not my name. John and Kelly cracked up and teased him. We never knew anyone called Jarissa. Im sure that it wasnt another women and he isnt cheating. I\u2019m completely sure of that. He also ordered a meal with tuna. I didnt say anything, but John made a remark saying he must be trying new things or something like that. My boyfriend absolutely despises tuna. It was small things like that, in addition to being much colder and quieter than usual. He is usually very outgoing and warm. On the plane back, we were snuggled up and he asked me to tell him \u201cstories\u201d. So i did, but he interrupted me and said \u201cno stories about us\u201d. So i did. And his response was off, as if he was hearing new information for the first time but pretending to have known all along. And then i told a fake story about skiing (he cant ski) with his family and he was nodding along. I made the decision to get him checked out for memory loss or something as soon as we were back. I was sleeping in the car ride home, and woke up briefly to him having taken us somewhere completely different instead of home. So i raised my concerns right there and then and told him he needs to get checked out. He stated that this was our home, and pointed to a house. He took the keys and walked up to the house and of course it didnt work. I demanded to drive back this time. The ride was extremely awkward. He couldnt open his phone,  because he had forgotten the passcode (thank god for face ID). I got a text and asked him to check it and he said \u201care you sure?\u201d. This is what we normally do. We dont usually ask, we just check it for eachother. \n\nHe also slept an extremely long time too. I went to the GP (General Practitioner. Sort of a family doctor) with him and told him point blank he needed to get checked out. I explained the situation to the doctor and he did a basic check up. We got a call the next day and the GP assured me that everything was completely OK. His cognition was apparently completely fine, no sign of long term or short term memory loss, which i argued against vehemently, seeing as he couldnt even remember his fucking passcode. The GP said that it was entirely possible he had some stress from the flight, since he has a mild fear of flying. I asked for a second opinion and evaluation, and the second GO also said theres no sign of head injury or anything and advised against seeing a neurologist without him. I called his mother to see if we could stay over for a while and his mother was happy to have us. She noticed a few changes in his personality but didnt really say anything much, just assumed that he was trying new things. His previous aversion to tuna had completely changed. I spoke to her in private and i mentioned other things too such as the fact he sleeps for incredibly long hours now, upwards of 9 hours, and how ive caught him staring at me sleeping and rifling through my journal, in which i keep pictures and notes of significant events for me. I also mentioned his coldness, and how his style of fucking has also completely changed and his smile is different. And then i started crying. Seriously i have no idea what to do. No one believes that something is wrong, but there is something so wrong with him. Its like his whole personality has shifted to the left. I entertained the possibility that it was a concussion which had caused me to assume that it was his fault, when in reality it was i who had made changes , but i have physical evidence and also evidence from his family that he has changed.\n\nIn videos his voice has changed, too. He way he speaks has changed. Literally any help is appreciated, thanks.\n\nEdit: edited for general comprehension. Also, i didnt contact a neurologist because the GP had advised not to. He also refuses to go since the GP said everything is fine. This is over a year ago and the changes are still there. Its settled down a lot but he is no longer as outgoing or warm and does some thing where he stares at certain objects or people for too long and then looks in my general direction and back, robotically. He also talks in the third person occasionally and its seriously unnerving. For a while we slept in separate rooms because i was so creeped out by his behaviour change. Its like hes barely even human sometimes, i seriously have no other way to describe it. Like some lizard person or something, and it creeps the hell out of me. He speaks in his sleep, too and its not in english or any other language i know. But it isnt complete gibberish because there is a flow to it. This has continued on and was part of the reason i wanted to sleep separately for a while.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be going to a neurologist myself tomorrow and explaining it, but there is little else i can do if he refuses to come along. \n(Sub edit: my boyfriend shuts down conversation everytime when i ask him what happened. He nearly opened up one time and started with \u201cthere was a goat\u201d and then stopped and refused to say anything else. Its so bizarre. How does a goat relate to this??)\n\nEdit 2: some of you seem to think im writing a horror story, so im making it abundantly clear right now: neither of us are religious or believe in ghosts, spirits or entities. I\u2019m not stupid enough to do more than entertain that idea briefly. I am going to a neurologist tomorrow and going down the logical route rather than the \u201cpossessed by a demon\u201d route.\n\n**Edit 3**\nI saw the doctor today on short notice, so the time slot was pretty small. My boyfriends mother agreed to go, as someone suggested bringing her along, and i showed her this post. I did most of the talking and the doctor seemed concerned. He said he will reference me to a neurologist but i need my boyfriend to come with me. Thats going to be the difficult part. If a doctor is expressing concern then i\u2019m genuinely incredibly worried over the health of my boyfriend now. I was before, but now it seems serious, and i wasnt aware of the severity til yesterday. I have til 8pm tomorrow to get him to come, so any suggestions on exactly HOW to would be great.\n\n#Also, addressing the people calling this fake and paranormal; just write off all possibility of ghosts, right now. \n\nI dont believe in any of that. A goat is entirely possible because there were goats that lived in this area, but i seriously have no idea how that could link to him getting lost or why he stops talking there. He could have followed a goat and got himself lost? It doesn\u2019t mean its paranormal, and i refuse to consider that seeing as there are a vast number of logical explanations.\n\nAlso, people telling me to break up with him: no.\n\n#Edit 4\n\nI convinced him to come to see a neurologist who specialises in brain injuries. Long story short; nothing. They scanned him, brought him in for psychological evaluation too. They tried telling me that perhaps there was something wrong with me, until i used video evidence. Today they did some blood work on him, since i mentioned swimming in lakes, and we\u2019re expecting results maybe in a week or so. He\u2019s going back tomorrow to see a psychiatrist, since there isnt anything obviously wrong in terms of injury to his brain. \n\nHe was sulky with me for a while, but we\u2019ve just rescued a litter of kittens so that requires us to talk to one another. I cant say things are looking up, but at least things are going somewhere.", "completion": "So first of al I agree with all the other comments to get him checked out. \n\nBut also, maybe ask for yourself as well?

I would ask myself the same thing over and over but still find myself wanting to stay because I wanted to believe these things would just work itself out. Six months ago, the arguing and fights began to intensify and I started to resent him. Two weeks ago we were in the car and he was criticizing me over a situation I was venting to him about, so I asked him why he always had to critique everything I did (no yelling on my part). He exploded in anger, told he was so angry he wanted to punch me in the face and tried to push me out of the car in the middle of the street with moving traffic. We ended up pulling over in a parking lot and I got out the car to walk on my own because I was scared and couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. As I started walking off, he gets out of his car and walks into the middle of the road with oncoming traffic and refused to get out of the street until I personally removed him. Cars braked rapidly and there was a lot of honking, while I am crying and pulling this man out of the road. I called a mutual friend of ours who can usually help call him down, and he did. He promised me for the millionth time he wasn\u2019t going to yell at me again and act out, I decided to let it slide once again. However, I didn\u2019t really let it slide because I kept replaying that scene over and over again in my head. Last week he yelled at me in the middle of a Dave & Busters over a parking spot, in front of everyone. I have begged him to go to therapy with me and he says it\u2019s a waste of money and that no therapist knows what they\u2019re talking about, \n\nToday, I decided that I needed to end the relationship for good. I wasn\u2019t happy anymore and his anger had officially pushed me over the edge. I couldn\u2019t even look at him the same way anymore. I told him everything I was feeling and I figured he would be really upset. He once again promised things would change and to give him a chance, begging me to stay. It hurt but I knew it was the right thing to do. I stood firm and said I no longer wanted to be with him. He started sending me text messages saying he was going to kill himself because of the breakup. I immediately got him on the phone and it just kept getting worse. I tried my best to calm him down but all he wanted to hear was that I would take him back. I didn\u2019t want to lie to him and couldn\u2019t give a false promise and he didn\u2019t take that well. I decided to call his mother because I was afraid he would actually hurt himself. I was at my dad\u2019s house while this was happening and he ended up going to my apartment (he has a key) to see if he would run into me, He then sent me text messages with pictures of him holding a suicide note and telling me that he loved me but he was done living if he couldn\u2019t have me. He ended up taking a bunch of pain killers and was drinking alcohol. My roommate found him in my bathroom barely able to stay awake. I rushed home while they called 911. Thankfully, we got him help at the right time and they were able to treat him for the OD. He is now at the hospital on a three day suicide watch. I stayed at the ER until his mother arrived and I spoke to him for a few minutes. He was hazy and crying, it broke my heart even more. I decided to leave to give him some space to rest and clear his head. \n\nI am battling these feelings that it\u2019s my fault and I shouldn\u2019t have broken up with him. Everyone tells me it\u2019s not but I cant help feeling this way. I am overwhelmed. When I got home, I found the suicide note he wrote me. He had left his bank information and said he was leaving me all his money, and to donate his organs. I don\u2019t even know what to feel or what to do right now. I am still in shock. Have I really been in a toxic relationship for two years? How did I let it get this bad? What is wrong with me? I want to visit him in the hospital to be there for him as a friend but I am not sure if that is a good idea, I don\u2019t know what to do. It feels like a bad dream.", "completion": "Have you been in a toxic relationship for years? Yes\n\nHow did I let it get this bad? Women don\u2019t fall in love with abusive men. They fall in love with men who become abusive. So, he moved the bar slowly into more and more abusive and you didn\u2019t notice until it was really bad because he\u2019s also either directly telling or implying that you don\u2019t deserve better. \n\nWhat is wrong with me? Nothing. However, to believe that a man abusing you is somehow something wrong with you means you\u2019ve fully absorbed his lesson that you\u2019re the problem not him.\n\nDon\u2019t visit him in the hospital. Don\u2019t ever communicate with him again. He only attempted suicide to manipulate you. He already had your full attention when he did it so he could be pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t die. Ignore him forever.\n\nI\u2019m 100% serious when I say you should literally move because when he finds out he can\u2019t contact you; he\u2019ll seek you so hard that things will be the worst they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nYou should google \u201cdomestic violence, emotional abuse\u201d and read every page until it starts to sound like this is what he did to you and you\u2019re upset about it. You should seek out community resources for victims of domestic abuse. You should seek therapy to help you recover. Your community may have free, low cost therapy available for victims of domestic violence. I wouldn\u2019t say you need a shelter at this point. GET YOUR LOCKS CHANGED BEFORE THE THREE DAYS ARE UP!\n\nThis is dangerous for you; forget trying to make him feel better and protect yourself."}
{"prompt": "There's been a man tapping at my window every night for a week now. Every time I go over to the window I see him skulking away. It is now 5:30 AM and I was woken up by him tapping at my window. I called the police and they couldn't do anything because nobody could find him. What should I do?\n\nEdit: Okay, so I'm getting many responses about firearms. This is definitely not something I'm interested in doing for multiple reasons.\n\nEdit 2: Hey everyone. I've been looking into a few things. So first and foremost, we all know that everything is half shut down right now, especially for me, since I live in NYC and this city is a hotspot for ther virus. Because of this, many places are closed, I can't exactly order anything which will get here in time for tonight. I'm planning on going to home depot to see if I can find anything I'm looking for.nIn the meantime, I've talked to my friend and me and him are going to wait outside my apartment tonight with an extra bright flashlight and see if this man shows up again. I want to be on the offensive. I will update later tonight or tomorrow if anything happens.\n\nEdit 3: So some of you are saying my plan is a bad idea, which... is probably true now that I think about it. If he has a gun and I'm unarmed this could end very badly for me, especially if we startle him with a flashlight. Some of you suggested putting a sign on my window. I am going to do this. My new plan is to wait outside with my friend like before, after putting the sign on my window. If this person comes by and is undeterred I will phone the police while keeping a safe distance across the street with my friend. Again, will update if anything happens.\n\nUPDATE! - I am currently waiting across the street with my friend. We are planning to spend the entire night here. We have beef jerky and breath of the wild on my switch to keep us occupied. Wish us luck.\n\nFINAL UPDATE! - Whoever guessed that a drug dealer used to live in my apartment is right. The guy who was tapping my window came by as expected around 4:30 last night. Me and my friend decided he didn't look too threatening so we confronted him! I asked him why he's been coming by for the last 4 nights. He told me he was looking for Seon with the edibles... I'm not sure what happened to Seon with the edibles. Nobody had been living here for like a year before I moved in. Anyway... That about sums up this mystery. Thanks for the advice everyone!", "completion": "INFO:  What's it like outside your window?  Is it a flower bed?  Is it nothing?  Is it a staircase? \n\nSome novel ideas:\n\n1.  Get liquid ass from amazon and spray it outside your window\n\n2.  Make it uncomfortable as possible to be outside your window.  Can you put allumium foil held down by rocks right underneath your window so it would make a lot of noise if he got close?  What about something else equally obnoxious? \n\n3.  Go to the hardware store and buy the \"smile! you're on camera\" signs and similar, see if that scares him off.  \n\n4.  Put your phone against the window (or an old phone) and see if that scares him off\n\n5.  Can you buy a motion activated water sprayer?\n\n6.  One of the best ways to scare people off -**battery powered motion activated outdoor light.  Movement= his area becomes illuminated and he no longer feels safe.**  Buy them on amazon. \n\n7.  You can also buy a **hunting battery operated motion activated camera**.  They are relatively low cost and you could probably strap it to anything.  Snaps a picture when it senses movement in the middle of the night, will also flash light.  Should scare him off and you get a picture."}

I don\u2019t think this is an odd request. We just moved in together, so this is a frustrating discovery. What say you?", "completion": "The bathroom is a space for getting clean. I feel all spaces we use should be kept clean out of respect for, at the very least ourselves, let alone the space itself and the others that use it - but if I had to choose one room to keep clean it's the bathroom! \n\nYes. He should clean up out of respect for the next person who will use the washroom - as if this could be himself."}

I don\u2019t want to be tied down with him forever and bringing a child into an unhappy relationship in my opinion is completely unfair. I don\u2019t want to be with him. I feel trapped. If anyone else has been in a similar situation please tell me your experience.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for everyone that has taken the time to read and respond to my post. I see that this is a divided topic and is clearly based on personal opinion but I do think I will tell him I miscarried. This is not only because it will make it easier for him but I could also be in physical danger if he knows I terminated the pregnancy.

The original post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9z2jff/my_brother_who_hated_religion_died_saturday_i/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nSome background:\n\nIn his last week of life, Brother was moved to our sister's house (who is an active nurse).  She selflessly accepted him in (despite two children and a work schedule that ICU/ER nurses have), and kept a \"baby monitor\" in the room; she was always available, cleaned him, turned him, etc... all of the needs that a dying person has, that only others whose family members are on the verge of dying can understand.\n\nI followed the more or less general consensus, and was preparing to create a coalition to protest a funeral so very much against who my brother was in life.\n\nAnd in my outrage... *I* somehow forgot who my brother was in life.\n\nI got a call from our Sis.  She wanted to check up on me, knowing how devastated I was by Brother's death.\n\nIn all of my anger, in all of my outrage... I never called the one person who had been caring for him.\n\nBrother foresaw our mother's pain, and agreed to a Roman Catholic burial.  He did not convert as I thought I was being told, or whatever the case may have been.\n\nSis did not believe it either, but assured me that she made sure they were alone, and spoke to him during a lucid period to verify that he actually agreed to it.\n\nThat was the kind of man my brother was.  In his very last days, as he lay dying, he cared more about how the pain and loss after he was gone would affect others, rather than about himself.\n\nI actually *was* the asshole, for only dwelling in my own pain and not realizing that this is exactly something Brother would do: \"sacrifice\" himself for the good of others.  Sacrifice is too strong a word, but you know what I mean.\n\nSo:  I officially thank the hundreds upon hundreds who took the time to comment, and the dozens who PM'd/DM'd me.  All of you, in all of your thoughts and beliefs on every side... again, thank you.  Brother and I always believed in hearing all sides without reservation.\n\nYou have -beyond doubt- shown that that caring towards others still holds true despite all of the hate and fingerpointing that currently seems so prevalent.\n\nA forum of complete strangers came together.  I love you all... and thank you so very, very much.\n\nI have on last thing to ask of you:\n\nDo a random act of kindness for a complete stranger, just once.\n\nI don't mean some faceless donation to charity or whatever, to some random whatever.  Instead, make a difference, if even for a moment, to some other person around you.  For no reason other than to brighten someone's day.\n\nGive a bag to someone who is short one at a checkout stand at your local grocery.  Offer to buy someone's coffee in line behind you. Help someone to cross a street, or offer to lead someone lost somewhere in a hospital. *Something*\n\nBecause these are the kind of things my brother did every day.

{"prompt": "I\u2019m new to Reddit and I made this account so I can get some help . I\u2019ve been dating my gf for 1 year now and i really need advice on what to do. Her family is illegal and her dad left when she was in 6th grade she has told me about Her brother being a pervert and I need advice on what to do here\u2019s some of the things he has done\n\n1. She has told me about multiple times he has told her to play fight/wrestle which is normal but when they do he grabs her by the waist or stomach and holds her against his crotch or he has tried to bend her over. She told me they have play fought before when they were younger and nothing happened but around 2 years ago is when he started doing weird stuff like that. I think it was bc she was going through puberty around 13 like most people do so he saw her more sexually now.\n\n2. He also has walks in on her while she is changing. she changes every time she gets home from school and he has to give her a ride back home most days. I know that this could be a accident but I promise I\u2019m not exaggerating it when I say it was a every day thing and I know he knows what he is doing and she knows as well that\u2019s why she tells me. \n\n3. He also has gone into her room while my gf was laying down comfortably with no shirt and no bra because she thought she was only home with her mom and sister after seeing him she held a blanket on her but then he asked if she was wearing a shirt my gf responded by telling him to get out and then he got up and took of her blanket \n\n4. Since her family is illegal only her brother and sister can work but since her sister really doesn\u2019t work at all her brother is the one that has to work but he uses that to take advantage of her. He has told her that if she doesn\u2019t give him a hug he will stop paying her phone bill and recently while I was spending time with her and her mom they found out they can check when to get a upgrade on there phone plan and when they were looking at it in the car they saw that her brother has been lying to them the whole time and could\u2019ve got her a new phone but instead kept lying and saying that it\u2019s not ready yet just so he has something to control her with and I\u2019m not lying either because her mom called her brother and asked him and he hung up on her mom\n\n5. He also talks to her like a guy trying to flirt with a girl. He has told her that she is thicker then a snicker while I was on the phone with her and he always try\u2019s to take her out to eat or get her to hang out with him \n\nI know this is long but I really need help I\u2019m only a sophomore in high school with my gf who is in the same grade as me and I\u2019m worried about her safety. we have broken up before because I have been really intense when it came to her being around him or anyone  and i got kinda toxic because I didn\u2019t trust anyone in her family we got back together after a couple days . I finally got her to ask her mom for a lock on her door and she got one two days ago but it\u2019s a really cheap one that you can still see a little crack in the door but it\u2019s better then nothing. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the best typed but I\u2019m just really scared and sad I need help I love this girl and I don\u2019t want to lose her she makes me happy and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt and she refuses to tell her mom because her mom already has a lot of stress which I can understand but I can\u2019t keep living with this regret that I haven\u2019t done anything about it", "completion": "Is there no way for your own family to have her over more often? and more often... more often...  \n  \nuntil she's all but moved in.  \n  \nNot a bizarre concept for HS couples that have been together long enough.

Why do you think this happens and how do I stop myself believing it so much?", "completion": "In psychology, this is called a \u201cself-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d When you believe something is true, you act as though it is true. Meaning, since you have been dispositioned to believe people don\u2019t like you based on previous experience, you automatically get that vibe from others. A lot of the time it is probably irrational, as you mentioned.\n\nEven in your example with your ex, it doesn\u2019t mean that people actually felt that way about you. Often our feelings that we think other people have are just a reflection of how we see ourselves. An example of this would be if you trip and fall in public. You will probably assume that people think you\u2019re dumb, clumsy, or that something is inherently wrong with you. However, there are many possibilities that someone seeing you trip would think such as \u201cis she okay?\u201d\n\nSince you\u2019re aware that this is irrational behavior, you can begin to fix the problem. Most of the time, this stems from your self-esteem. If you have a low self-esteem, you are more likely to feel this way often. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help work through these thoughts by offering a justification and resolution to negative irrational thoughts. However, that\u2019s not always an option for people. There are infinite resources on self-fulfilling prophecies, negative self-talk, and other principles that people commonly feel. YouTube and Google searches can give you a lot of insight (or at least help you understand this is a common occurrence in most people).

{"prompt": "So backstory: I (22F) went to college for Engineering, a course they forced me to take when I really wanted to do art. I was still dead set on making it with art even if I had to do it on my own so I worked hard and self studied and eventually I guess I got good enough for professional work.

My mom, of course, doesn\u2019t believe this because she only listens to her officemates who probably has a friend of a cousin of a friend (or whatever the fuck) who makes pretty good money. I\u2019m perfectly aware that that\u2019s possible but I\u2019m shit at Engineering; Art is what I\u2019m good at and they won\u2019t accept it.\n\nAnother reason she\u2019s so against it is because the healthcare benefit doesn\u2019t cover them so of course this job is no use to HER and she even said that herself. Apparently, my siblings are both married so it\u2019s my job to cover them and sacrifice what I want in life to cater to them.

I thanked here for the compliment and then politely told her I\u2019m in and happy relationship and that ended there. Now today I get a call from my gf saying she set the whole thing up. Why? It\u2019s annoying to me and it hurts because I do everything with her and I pretty much almost give her anything she wants. I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship where there\u2019s this much level of untrust, because like come on a year and 4 months? If I really wanted to cheat I would\u2019ve done something by now. Idk I just think if she did it once she\u2019ll definitely do it again and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very happy in a relationship like that.\n\n**Update**\nGF says she\u2019s really sorry and that I could trust her but doesn\u2019t know why she did it nor can she give me an answer why.

{"prompt": "Link to the original post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e3h5n7/my_best_guy_friend_did_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone will care but I think way things turned out in my situation is important. \n\nTl:Dr E was in a mental health crisis. He didn\u2019t need to be dropped, he was desperately clinging to his support system. \n\n\n\nWhen I made my initial post almost everyone said to drop E and run away from the whole situation. That felt wrong to me. Instead I got the people that he loves the most together to talk about his behavior. I didn\u2019t think that someone who was reacting to things the way that he was could possibly be in a good mental state, and I was afraid for my friend. \n\nFirst, I contacted R and and him if he was actually interested in being romantically involved with me. He was. So we set up a time for the two of us, to sit down with E and his girlfriend to talk about why he got so angry seeing R and I together. \n\nIt was a long conversation with lots of question dodging and tears, but in the end we started to unravel things a little bit. Here\u2019s the basic summary:\n\nE and R\u2019s dad left their mom when they were both very young. He stayed in contact with them until he got married. E was 13 and hasn\u2019t spoken to his father since then. E never received more than a few days of therapy for this. (And this is when he started having outbursts of anger).  They have another brother, L, who is a few years older than R. (Never mentioned him before because that original post was long enough and he was irrelevant). L became like a father figure to R and E after their actual dad cut contact. Then L got married about a year ago, and moved out off the house they lived in together, and became much more distant. Making E and R even closer. \n\nL didn\u2019t leave entirely but E still felt like he lost a branch of his support system. Since L got married E\u2019s mental health has been steadily getting worse. He was always prone to both anxiety attacks and depressive episodes in the past. Never diagnosed with anything officially because he wouldn\u2019t go to a doctor, but when L became distant those things started getting much worse. E tried to keep it from everyone because he didn\u2019t want anyone to worry. His girlfriend noticed a change, but E insisted to her that he was fine. \n\nYou\u2019re probably sensing a pattern in E\u2019s life. Someone he cares about gets married, and stops being in contact with him. After some talking we found out that lots of E\u2019s panic attacks are triggered by a fear (no matter how illogical) of losing people. \n\nAfter a long time insisting that we still loved him and we were there because we loved him, E finally told us why he freaked out at Friendsgiving.  When he saw R and I kiss he suddenly panicked, thinking that he was about to lose both his best friend and his brother to a relationship. In his mind the only way to keep us around was to make sure we didn\u2019t date, and his reaction was the incident you read in the original post. \n\nE acknowledges that the way he acted was toxic, abusive,  and a bad way to handle the situation. He also said that he doesn\u2019t mind if R and I date, and he doesn\u2019t have romantic feelings for me. After much debate we finally convinced him to get a therapist and to stop drug use. To try it for at least for six months. He seems like he\u2019s ready to get better. \n\nOverall I\u2019m saying that while there is no hope in some situations you should still try to talk to people who are behaving erratically. There\u2019s probably a reason they\u2019re doing it. They may even know what the reason is. A cry for help doesn\u2019t always sound like one. If your friends act in a way that is abnormal and negative, don\u2019t immediately run away, try to help. If I had run away my best friend, who was already spiraling, would have been in a position that was so much worse.", "completion": "This is a good lesson for people, there may be something deeper going on that what is being displayed. \n\nGood on you for being a good friend."}
{"prompt": "I thought I would just post a quick update in regards to [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l9deas/strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs\\_neighbour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l9deas/strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs_neighbour/)\n\nThanks for your advice everyone.\n\nSo I have been keeping the recordings. On the next evening, I contacted the police saying I was concerned about her behaviour not that I was complaining about the nuisance. They advised me to contact Lewisham Environmental Health Office, as it was late I didn't really think about it but the next day I realised someone was just fobbing me off, what has it got to do with EHO? So I didn't bother\n\nOver the next few days, it escalated, becoming more frequent so I contacted them again only to be told they have noted it down but there is nothing they can do at this stage but to keep informing them. It continued to escalate that day, getting more violent [http://dropshare.rebelinblue.com/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ/](http://dropshare.rebelinblue.com/LSmiHNmm6Fg0hNLJMzVQ/) so I contacted them at 10pm and they said they would report it to the Safer Neighbour Team who would contact me.\n\nThe next day they turned up, although there was some confusion because even though I have a SE26 postcode which is Sydenham I am actually in Forest Hill (looked it up and the boundary literally runs down the middle of the road so one side is Sydenham the other Forest Hill). I showed them the footage, including videos at 2am and 4am and they agreed that it is creepy and concerning, they asked if I wanted them to speak to her but said it possibly wasn't a good idea until they can report it to the correct Neighbourhood Team as it may make things escalate further. I agreed. So they gave me the contact details for the Forest Hill team and asked me to email them the videos.\n\nBefore I got round to it I got a phone call from the team just confirming how to get to the flat (it is a bit of a PITA to find) but as I was out I said they may not be able to get in as the front door is normally locked and I am the only one with a doorbell.\n\nWe agreed that they would talk to her as if there was a concern for her rather than about her. They phoned me back in the afternoon and said they had spoken to her and she seemed normal if maybe a bit slow, she denied knocking on the door and they said they had seen footage to which she said she was just knocking to chat and they told her it was not appropriate at 4 in the morning. At this stage, I think they assumed I was probably someone just complaining about a noisy neighbour and she maybe wasn't very bright and hadn't realised the problem with knocking at 4 in the morning. But they asked me to send them the videos so I sent a couple of choice highlights like the one above and one of her racing up the stairs doing it and racing back down... I got back the reply \"OK Yeah, those videos speak for themselves don't they!\"\n\nThey concluded, like I had, that she was unwell so referred the case to social services. They advised that maybe she was sleepwalking and that I should maybe get a stair gate for now. I said I didn't want to because I was worried that if she was sleepwalking she may try and climb over and hurt herself but I would keep it under advisement.\n\nTuesday night she kept me up most of the night, then again Wednesday night, I missed work yesterday due to lack of sleep. At this point I thought \"fuck it I really don't care if she hurts herself now\" so brought a stair gate... but I am not an arsehole so did look for one wide enough to go on the landing so that if she fell she wouldn't fall down the stairs but unfortunately the only one I could find was 4 to 6 weeks delivery so settled for one on the top of the stairs. I also contacted the officier again to ask if there was any news and he said once it had been referred it was out of their hands so he had no idea but said I might want to report it again and consider a harassment report.\n\nI informed the freeholder than I was installing a gate at the advice of the police and his response was simply \"OK thanks\".\n\nYesterday I was out at the shop over the road and she came in, she left before me and after I came out she came running across the road saying she had locked herself out of her flat and could she wait in mine, obviously there was no chance so I made up a lie about just doing some shopping then going to a meeting so I put my shopping away and went out for a walk. By the time I was back someone had come with the key thankfully.\n\nI installed the stairgate last night when it arrived.\n\nShe didn't knock overnight but I am 99% sure that is a pure coincidence as the camera would have caught her coming up the stairs... Literally, as I said this to a colleague she came up the stairs, climbed over and banged on the door.\n\nIt slowed her down enough for me to get to the door to confront her but she just ignored me. A few minutes later she came out and opened the gate. So I went out and put a bike lock on it to see what happened.\n\nHalf an hour later the camera has her coming out, checking to see if I was there then realising there is something on the gate so examining it, then when I came out she legged it. That was enough evidence for the police to finally take it seriously, sleepwalking people don't check to see if anyone is watching them or stop to examine locks so they are sending someone out today but said to phone back immediately if she becomes aggressive.\n\nShe's been back to look at it a few times so far.\n\nExhausting!\n\nUPDATE 1 (Friday afternoon): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gn34jav/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gn34jav/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 2 (Friday evening): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gn48zsm/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gn48zsm/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 3 (Saturday morning): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gn5ndlc/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gn5ndlc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 4 (Saturday afternoon): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gn8wwml/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gn8wwml/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 5 (Saturday evening): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gnbm7u6/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnbm7u6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE 6 (Sunday morning): https://reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/_/gned9gf/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 7 (Sunday evening): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update\\_strange\\_behaviour\\_from\\_new\\_downstairs/gnhb4vq/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnhb4vq/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nMAJOR UPDATE 8 (Monday morning):  https://reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/_/gnily1x/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 9 (Monday evening): https://reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/_/gnkxn86/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 10 (Tuesday morning): https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnmtket\n\nUPDATE 11 (Tuesday afternoon): https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnn1fza?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 12 (Wednesday morning): https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnr7vkw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 14 (Thursday morning): https://reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/_/gnv4igd/?context=1\n\nUPDATE 15 (Thursday lunchtime): Hopefully the final update https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnvn9vo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 16 (Friday morning): Final update https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gnzduqg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 17 (Friday evening): Final update for real this time\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/go13jpw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 18 (Monday evening): So maybe it's not over... https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/goec3io?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 19 (Tuesday evening): It has gone to court, so here are the insane videos\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/goi80m7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nUPDATE 20 (Thursday evening): https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/li84c6/update_strange_behaviour_from_new_downstairs/gorbjvl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3", "completion": "That's crazy.

{"prompt": "Posting on a second account as my husband knows the username of my main account. Please read the whole post if you have the time.\n\nI will have been married to my husband for three years next month. Been together for six years total. Like all couples, we\u2019ve had our ups and downs but he is the love of my life. Since the beginning of our relationship, I have always told him how family was very important to me and that being a mother was my ultimate life goal. I\u2019ve always wanted nothing more than to have children, give them the best life I could give them, and protect them with all that I have. He knew this and agreed that family and children are a big deal for him as well. But we wanted to wait until we were done with our education and stable before we pursued having children.\n\nEarly November, we decided to start TTC (Trying to Conceive) and this is when things started taking a turn. We agreed that though we are trying for a baby, we still wanted to make the sex exciting and didn\u2019t want it to feel like a chore. So we decided to start trying new kinks and fetishes to make things fresh and fun. Mid-summer, he expressed he wanted to try out DDLG. For this kink, he would be the daddy and I would be the little girl. My roles consisted of wearing pacifiers, children\u2019s girl underwear, and to talk like a baby while he would talk like a parent calling me \u201cprincess\u201d and \u201cbabygirl\u201d. He would also mention my intimate area as \u201cprincess parts\u201d. Thought I thought it was an interesting kink, I didn\u2019t complain and just went with it.\n\nWell he ended up liking the role-play so much that it became a common occurrence and he wanted to do DDLG at least two or three times a week because he \u201cloved the lifestyle\u201d. Again, strange but I was so busy with life and tracking my cycles that I pushed it off. Then comes January. He expressed that he wants to try out incest role-play. The main roles he wanted to try out were Mother/Son and Father/Daughter. I honestly wasn\u2019t okay with this one and expressed this to him, but he convinced me that it was to just add spice and keep things fun. So I went along with it. But this morning everything changed. My husband has a habit of falling asleep to Youtube videos or Twitch streams so he often wakes up with his phone on low battery since it\u2019s just on all night. I woke up this morning (I\u2019m usually up before him) to see that his phone screen was on while he was asleep. So I picked it up to put it on the charging stand and on his phone, I saw porn. The video that he had finished watching was a Father Daughter incest porn video. I opened up his Safari history and saw that he had been viewing just father and daughter incest porn since around the time we started the DDLG role-play.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s extreme but I am considering a divorce because I can not imagine having a child with my husband with everything I\u2019ve found. I feel bad but I can not continue this relationship if we can\u2019t have children sometime in the future. And right now I\u2019m unsure of having children with him. As I said, being a mother means everything to me and I would hate to put my children in a dangerous situation. It would hurt me if I found out that my child got harmed and it was partly due to my poor choices. I recognize that watching a certain porn doesn\u2019t mean you would actually do these things but it\u2019s evident he\u2019s been really into this for awhile and he gets so passionate whenever we role-play scenarios where he plays a father figure and I play his child. It\u2019s scaring me.\n\nTLDR; My husband has been fixated on incest-related kinks when we\u2019re trying to have a baby and it\u2019s making me consider divorce.\n\nEdit: I have decided I\u2019m going to proceed with a divorce.

{"prompt": "Backstory:\nMy parents wanted me and my brother to stay at their house over night for Xmas eve. My girlfriend has trouble sleeping alone so I decided to take her with me for the night.\n\nNow, my GF and my brother had had a weird relationship a while back and he was manipulative enough that she developed some strange tendencies about him, similar to that of an abusive relationship.\n\nThe Event: My GF and I are going to sleep. I pass out and wake up 15 minutes later to the sound of distant moaning. I get out of bed and the hair stands up on the back of my neck as I realize that my GF is not in my room. I sneak out into the hallway and I hear my GF giggling and laughing from my brothers room. I hear her whisper \u201cbe careful\u201d.\n\nI march straight into my brothers room where I find my brother pretending to be asleep (but still obviously breathing heavily) and my GF laying next to him. She still has her clothes on and she acts like nothing is going on but she\u2019s being a little defensive.\n\nI ask her what happened and she eventually admits that he had kissed her. She also later admits that she was moaning because he was touching her. She started off saying that she stopped him as soon as she could and that she only went in there to talk to him. I brought up that she could have left a lot sooner and that I could hear her moaning and she admired that she didn\u2019t intend for things to get sexual, but she did let it happen because she still had feelings for him.\n\nGF drove back home in the middle of the night and I soon did the same, sending my parents a quick heads up explaining why I left.\n\nPresent:\nNow I\u2019m getting texts from both my parents saying that they are sad that I left and that family should stick together. My mom said that she\u2019s sorry I got caught up between my brother and GF which makes me feel like she didn\u2019t respect my relationship with her and that it was always more about her and y brother.\n\nThey want me to hear my brothers side of the story. He has a history of using women and my parents usually respond with \u201che\u2019s just not a relationship guy\u201d even though he uses obvious manipulation tactics.\n\nI really thought my parents would have my back on this one. Why does it feel like they care less about my situation and just want me to forgive my brother so we can have a normal Christmas?\n\nWhat do I do?!\n\nUpdate: Turns out my brother never made a move and she was the one trying to start shit. We\u2019ve been together for almost a year now and I had no idea she was manipulating me the whole time. Feels like a mind-fucky plot twist at the end of a movie. My brain is inside out.\n\nFinal update:\nI am absolutely dumping my GF. I recommended that she get psychiatric help because she shows some big signs of BPD. However, I also made it clear that what she did was unforgivable. No coming back from that.\n\nIt\u2019s also apparent that both the GF and my brother were lying about what actually happened. There\u2019s no reason for her to confess to messing around with him if it didn\u2019t happen; odds are, my brother is lying about being innocent in the matter.\n\nFor my family\u2019s sake, I will try to get along with him on holidays, but I absolutely do not trust him.\n\nThank you all for your support. It really means a lot to me. I never would have thought that this could happen to me and it\u2019s honestly a bit surreal.\n\nAlso my now-ex got me a super nice espresso machine for Christmas and I sure as hell intend on taking it with me.", "completion": "So your brother didn\u2019t make a move initially but still continued to fool around with her or?

In my late teens (17-19) I dropped out of high school to raise my baby brother from 1 month to 18 months, I took in my two younger sisters aged 15 and 16, and I was tough because that's what I had to be. I worked and provided for my siblings. I tried my best to be flexible, understanding, and 2 parents to my siblings since that what I felt they deserved. With the last one off to college and my brother being taken back by his mother. I have been alone. With nobody to live for the shadow has grown immensely and taken over me. \n\nI went through depression like I have never experienced, gained weight, became suicidal, and lost my drive. I find it hard to live for myself because I don't feel I'm worth it. I blame myself for the abuse and have always hated myself because of it. My self confidence, worth, and image are awful and toxic. However I'm an optimist, out going, supportive, and outwardly positive person. I try and not let other people know I'm hurting. \n\nI have been unemployed since March due to covid. The past couple weeks the well was starting to look empty, so I began job hunting. Applying for everything and every job I got offered a position into a corporate manager training program. Don't ask me how. I've only ever worked as a cook or server in restaurants. My car broke down and junked months ago. So I was looking at working within biking distance at a local restaurant when I was offered the position. \n\nNow I'm looking at working downtown and I live an hours walk to the nearest bus station and an hour and a half away by bus.

It was obviously genuine and I think I might've caught him off guard. It was nice getting advice. Honestly it felt like what I imagine having parents in the picture would be like.

{"prompt": "I\u2019m going to start with why this scenario even happened.\n\nAll my life, I was super feminine. Not in the way I dressed or acted, it was my body. I\u2019m frail and small, and I probably have more estrogen in my body than testosterone. Whenever I transferred schools or had a new teacher, the teacher would always think a girl in my class do my work for me because even my handwriting was feminine. I was assigned a pen pal in foreign language class, and that pen pal was going to come to my school the next semester for foreign exchange. The teacher wanted us to write to that person to get to know them before they came. That pen pal thought I was a girl until they asked, four letters later because they were \u201cattracted to me.\u201d My unisex name doesn\u2019t help. Because of my femininity, people made fun of me for it. Harassed me constantly. Even my friends joke and call me their \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d And a few days before the assault happened, I found out some boys had a sexual fantasy about me, especially cause at the time my hair was a bit longer, just touching my chin, and was dyed blue and purple. They thought because I had a feminine hairstyle means I\u2019m asking for it. Apparently, a lot of the boys in my high school have trap fantasies. \n\nAnyway, you get the jist. Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nI was at a friend\u2019s 16th birthday party. I started talking to this guy (M18) and we were just slightly tipsy. I\u2019m bicurious, so I thought I might as well explore my sexuality since he\u2019s already getting handsy. Plus, I trusted him. He thought my femininity didn\u2019t matter, and people are just creepy. We eventually were in the guest room, and to put it bluntly, he was jerking me off. That part was consensual. Everything was going okay until I heard snickers in the room. The room was completely dark, and you couldn\u2019t see a thing. I thought it was nothing, and it was just the guy I was with. Then it happened again. It sounded like a female, two females. I tell the guy to stop, there\u2019s someone else in the room. He didn\u2019t respond. I yelled at him to stop, and kneed him in the face. At this point, I knew there were four people in the room but I didn\u2019t know who, because there were only four voices that seemed familiar but I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it. I tried to get my pants on and leave the room, but the guy pinned me down. I don\u2019t remember exactly what he was whispering in my ear, but it was always along the lines of \u201cstay still\u201d or \u201cwere just gonna have some fun\u201d and trust me, I was freaked out. I tried to do everything I could to get him off me, but he was stronger. He didn\u2019t realize he was raping me, because he did everything he could to make me \u201cfeel good.\u201d Surprise, just because you use lube doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t hurt them. And while I was crying and telling him to stop, those four people just watched. I think one even took a flash picture. After he was done, they left me there, door wide open and turned he lights on so if anyone walked in on me, they would think I\u2019m some creep and kick me out. But, no one walked in. I was just laying there. After an hour or two, I got dressed and left the party. I walked home even though it hurt to take every step.\n\nWhen it was school again on Monday, I figured out who those four people were. My good friend told me that those four people who I thought were my friends/acquaintances told a lot of people what happened and they pretended that I was a slut and wanted it, and I put on a \u201cshow\u201d for all of them.

These dudes are intentionally trying to make you feel like shit, NOTHING they are saying is true, don't let them get you down. Find a way to make it fun for yourself instead. Might not be a good suggestion until you work up more confidence and shake off the cobwebs of your abusive relationships.\n\n4. Play games where no one talks to each other in-game, like Destiny 2 (I've literally only ever been in ONE game where someone used their mic)\n\n5. Play single player games\n\n6.

This morning in particular, I absolutely *despised* having to wake up and get ready. I didn't get much sleep, and because I'm forced to car-pool (ride with other people in the same car, so we can use HOV lanes) to work, I didn't have the option to show up late, or even take off work (well, I *could*, but it would be really crappy for them, plus I don't get much PTO to begin with).\n\nI'm really starting to re-assess what I'm doing with my life.\n\nYes, I could absolutely stay with my company and one day retire.

Jesus, this just doesn't feel like how humans are supposed to live.

They say they'll clean their mess up, or they won't have food or water in there, or they'll ask before coming into my room, but they still do it anyway. \n\nIt's really frustrating, and I try not to get angry at them besides letting them know I don't like the messes they make because I feel incredibly guilty. Yesterday was my breaking point. I left for work at 8:30am and came home at 5:00pm. I worked on university assignments until 8:30pm and was ready to chill and play Animal Crossing. \n\nWhen I walked into my room, it was absolute chaos.

The only issue here is that he/she may be legally bound to report it.

We were all close friends back then despite the age gaps since not many children were in our neighborhood. For some reason, I had this godforsaken idea to take my penis out and wank in front of them. I don't exactly recall if we were laughing about it or not. I thought it was a normal thing to do because during the time when I was in camp, on 6th grade, I heard that the other boys were showing off each other their penises and stuff. \n\nI recently just recalled this memory because of another one that happened way way back my childhood. I was laying in bed when suddenly, I realized I was basically abused by a man when I was 7. I was playing with another kid back then on the arcade when the man started talking to us and last thing I know, he started touching me and ended up wanking my penis. I didn't knew back then that what he did was not okay but I was confused about the sensation it caused and yet, I chose not to tell my parents when I got home. I am also introverted and quiet , which contributed to me being silent about it.\n\nNow, I think I'm a horrible human being and that I don't deserve anything good that ever happened to me. I'm feeling really low right now because of this realization. I'm 20 and maybe the fact that I was gay meant that what I did back then was absolutely something sexual and not just playful experimentation. I don't know what to do. I want to apologize to them but they've moved years ago and we haven't talked since but we're still connected through our social media. I'm scared to talk about this to my current friends because I'm afraid of how they will react. I even doubt if I should post it here because I basically caused this, myself. I would very much appreciate any advice on what to do because I'm afraid of what it would lead into if I continue having this suffocating feeling on my chest.", "completion": "I have several words for you.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am so sorry that you were abused.\n\nSecond, you didn't know what you were doing. You just said that you didn't know. Usually, people or kids who have been abused are more prone to abuse others in the future (than people who never were). But, one reason for children or teens doing that, might be that they don't know if it is right or wrong since it happened to them already as well. \n\nI am no professional so I don't know enough to understand and explain this. But here comes the second thing that I have for you: [Rainn.org](https://www.rainn.org/), a free anonymous chatline where you can talk to trained volunteers about what happened to you and help you make sense of it. They aren't your therapist but they might help you grasp a bit, find some resources to read so you can understand better what happened, and they also can help you find the next steps that you might want to take, following your pace and wishes, including helping find a therapist. I highly recommend them.\n\nThe third thing I have for you is to consider, if you want and feel it's right for you, to find a therapist that you can talk with to help make sense of things and make peace with everything that happened, from the man who hurt you to when you inadvertedly might have hurt the other kids.\n\nThe fourth, and this will be highly personal, but whenever/if you're ready, and if you feel it makes sense to you, is to find those kids that you talked about in your story, and talk with them. Some reasons why I think that might be a good idea:\n\n- They might not remember it, and they might have had a trauma that affects them in their life and relationships, and they don't know because they repressed the memory;\n\n- They might remember it, but still struggle to make sense of it (and half-repress it just as an 'odd memory'; or think if they might have imagined it. This might help them understand things better as well.\n\n- They might remember it, and still feel hurt about it, and even though you contacting them might cause them to relive the hurt again, that might also help them in their journey. I would be terrified if my abuser apologized to me, but he was also a man and knew very well what he was doing. A truthful apology and willingness to listen and understand their story if they want to talk (or share yours if you want) might help all hearts heal even if it hurts first. At the same time, when I was little, younger kids showed off their genitals to me, and while I was shocked at the time by the behaviour, it would be awkward for me to hear from them apologizing to me, but they were also younger than 5, so I'd rather just not talk about it anymore lol, I understand they didn't know what they were doing.\n\nThis is very a very personal journey, though. The feeling on your chest unbearable, please find someone you can talk to, whether it is a real life friend, an internet friend, or a new internet friend at r/momforaminute, r/dadforaminute, r/internetparents. Or just a therapist if you can find one. \n\nLast things I want to say, you are NOT a horrible human being. First of all, you just remembered it and felt guilty. That is 100% not horrible human being behaviour. Second, you were a kid, and you were having sequels from an abuse you didn't even remember because you repressed it and you had absolutely no support about.\n\nListen, my friend. You deserve to find help. And you didn't cause this yourself. A man caused it to you first. \n\nAnd you don't have to tell anyone about it. The people you tell about you just have to tell when you feel safe and comfortable. Unfortunately, these days it's still a hit or miss to find someone irl who will believe a boy's story of sexual abuse, depending on your social circles and all. My suggestion is to make both stories a separate thing . Find first someone who will understand that you have been abused. Then give it time. Don't make it \"I have been abused but then it's my fault because I then did this to two kids\". Breathe, calm down, even if it's burning in your chest, save it for next time. I have blurted to people things that I wasn't ready to blurt out because I felt guilt to tell more details than I was ready to tell. And you also want to know that you can count on those people to support you and not judge you before you tell the other story.\n\nAlso, being gay doesn't mean being an abuser, that's most probably just unrelated. \n\nI wish you the absolute best - again I totally recommend RAINN, they are absolutely amazing. This is all your personal journey as well so listen to your feelings, take care of yourself. \n\nLast advice is that the next days and months might feel shit for you and like a rollercoaster of emotions, but if you can find some support and take care of yourself, you will eventually find some peace in your life again.\n\nI truly wish you the best, you deserve help and love and safety and to take back control of your life at your own wishes and pace, this is your journey. Don't blame yourself for anything, for not having spoken up, for not opening up to people, please be gentle to yourself."}

{"prompt": "I made a post on Monday when I found out I was pregnant.  I was totally freaking out and got some great advice that really saved me from doing something completely stupid. \n\nSo on Tuesday I found out I had an ectopic pregnancy, something I had never heard of before, and needed to have a surgical abortion that afternoon.   That went very well, according to my mom's doctor, and I was able to go home after it was done.   I'm not sore but just achy and crampy and bleeding a lot.  \n\nThis week is a blur.   Right now I am feeling so lonely and isolated and afraid.   I haven't been to school since Monday morning and need to go back tomorrow.  There are only a few people who know I was pregnant and had the abortion.  Those are my parents, my friend's parents, my doctor and his staff, and that's it.  I haven't said anything to my friends but they keep asking why I'm not in school and I don't know what to tell them.    \n\nI have to go back tomorrow and I feel like there I'm wearing a letter of shame because of what happened.   I want everything to return to normal but I know it can't.   I'm gonna need to figure out what to say to people and how to deal with things if someone finds out.   I heard there may already be a rumor about me being in the hospital and don't know if someone heard something or saw me there or what it's all about.   \n\nHow do I deal with this shame?   I feel like such a terrible person right now because of what I did.  I practically begged my friend to have sex with me and when he did I got pregnant and had to tell him and then he was all nice and supportive but I haven't seen him since Wednesday morning when he stopped on his way to school to give me some flowers and I think he texted me yesterday but i wasn't up to talking to anyone because I'm sick and crampy and disgusting.  \n\nHow can I go to school tomorrow?  Should I text my friend back or wait for him to get back to me?  What should I tell my friends and teachers?   I think they will know what happened just by looking at me.  I don't look the same.  I don't feel the same.

{"prompt": "(F)I am posting this incase something happens to me. This situation has been going on for four years now and it continues to worsen. As I post this, I am still underage but I can understand the severity of the situation. I can't reveal to much information about what's going on because my abuser is currently in jail and still has an open case about what's going on but I need to put this somewhere incase something happens to me. \nThis person groomed me when I was 13, he was going on 17. From the second week of talking to him I knew there was something off about him. He had told me how he had killed people and was being paid for it. He was weirdly obsessed with me and being overly sexual at times and possesive. I even pretended to date my girl best friend so he would leave me alone. When this happened, he pretended to slit his wrist and sent pictures to me and my friend. Her mom called the police and he got in trouble but it was really just a slap on the wrist. This happened the week right before new years in 2017. He left me alone for about two months.\nHe started contacting me again in February and started telling me about how he was selling drugs and doing other extremely suspicious stuff.\nHe began to threaten me and say he was going I shoot up my house. It got to the point where someone even came to my house and was walking around outside one night when my dad wasn't home. My parents had no idea this was going on but I ended up talking to the school officer and he talked to the kid and told him to leave me alone and he did. He had threatened to shoot up my house and send people after me because he was angry we couldn't be in a relationship. This happened in March of 2018.\nSo excatly a year pasts and I walked into the room we met for practice and my friend who knew what had happened told me that he had gotten arrested for shooting up someone's house. It ce out later on that he held his then girlfriend at knife point and then shot up her friends house. \nSo I can't talk about what happened after that but basically he contacted me and abunch of really bad stuff started happening. I can't go too much into detail but my parents took me to the police station and one of the officers said that with all the evidence and surrounding factors he was trying to sex traffict me with blackmail and extortion.\nSince this has happened, he was released on bail and continued to make over ten fake accounts and continusly harass me saying extremely vulgar and disturbing things. My parents reported it only so many times before they stopped because the police were doing absolutely nothing about what was going now.\nNow with that being said, I have been being harrassed by someone which I know he must be involved with. I think it's his girlfriend and one of his friends but I am not certain. He was arrested in October and the harrassment still continues.\nAbout three weeks ago, A man showed up at my house one day when my parents were not home and I did not recognize him so I did not answer the door. Both my parents were an hour away so I called my mom and asked her if it was someone my dad was expecting and she said he was not expecting anyone. We were on the phone for a minute and she told me to see if they were still there and the guy was walking to his car. So I told her that and she said stay on the phone and I did and all of a sudden he was walking back to the house with what I assume was a women. The guy was probably 5'9-5'10 and looked like he was in his late 20s. There was a tall women with blonde hair but I did not see her face. I told my mom this and she said don't go by the door and they knocked. They went back to their car and came back knocked about three times over the span of 20 minutes. While this was happening my mom hung up and called the police. \nWhile I was waiting I saw a white mini van drive past my house twice pretty slow. The officer asked if I saw what the car look like and I said not because it was behind the camper in our drive way. I told him I saw a white mini van drive by twice and he said there was a white car pulled off to the side of the road across from my house. He left and he said if anything happy to call and he'll come back. \nSo I had taken a picture of them in my driveway and my dad said he did not recognize them and no one else in the house did. My dad asked a few of his friends if it was them or if they knew who it was and even posted it on face book and no one knows who it was.\nalso when we came back from the funeral last weekend our front door was wide open my dad had to go in to see if somebody was in the house because he was the last one out and had shut and locked the door. No one was in the house but things in our downstairs area were moved around. \nNothing has happened since but I am becoming more and more worried that soemthing is going to happen to me. The police do not seem concerned and this person is getting released with in the next 1-2 years. I could really use some advice about this situation because I really don't know what to do. Please do not report this or try to figure out who I am because if you try to help by contacting the police nothing will happen.", "completion": "Go to the FBI. Now. They\u2019ll handle this.

{"prompt": "We currently have nine cats. *Nine*. I cannot take it anymore. We burn through cat food, which has to be an expensive brand because of my roommate's cat and its bowel problems. The house and my clothes are constantly covered in hair. It always smells in here. My furniture is forever ruined. One of the little buggers always has diarrhea and goes outside of the box. Another one likes to spray on everything even though he is fixed.\n\nI am sick of it. When we moved into this house, a little less than two years ago, we had three cats, one of which came along with the property. That's a lot, but manageable. We then asked a friend to move in and he brought along his two cats. Five. Okay, that's a little too many, but I wasn't being driven insane, yet. \n\nThen we bring in two stray kittens that are now adults. Then a cat shows up and my girlfriend mistakenly brings it in, but instead of putting it back out immediately she puts up a fight about how the cat belongs to *someone* and we need to shelter it from the incoming severe weather. I went to sleep pissed, but I actually expected her and my roommate to make an effort of finding that cat's home, instead of going to two houses and calling it quits. Then, another cat. \n\nHere I am. Overwhelmed by cats. I am tired of it. I'm ready to find five cats good homes. I do not want to take them to a shelter, but I am not opposed to it.

If they're draining your income and emotional health, you need to straight-up tell her that you'll work with her to find them homes, but most of them have to go. Don't assume she'll do it on her own. Sit down with her and your roommate and tell them you're serious about this, and that worst-case scenario, you will have to send some to the shelter. Make sure they understand that if they don't put effort into getting homes for these animals, they will be sent to a shelter and could very well die there.\n\nIt's totally not ok for you to have to live with that, especially when you're this uncomfortable.

Just dumb stuff and never did I ever cross a line.\n\nRecently she sat me down in a serious tone and started to talking in a shaky tone and saying she cheated on me with a random guy. I was so shocked and in disblief. She kept the lie going for about 30 min in wich I kept asking her if she was lying because I genuinely didn't believe it. I also started to lose all hope and love in those 30 min as my heart slowly started to snap in half. It genuinely felt like someone ripped my heart out and punched back in until it broke. I genuinely almost had an panic attack. I grabbed my shit and just started walking to the door as I didn't know what to do, because I was reaching an emotional limit I didn't want to reach.

{"prompt": "Male, 24, United States\n\nAround a week ago, a landscaping company had cut my internet cable by accident while they were working on the lawn around my complex.  Thus, our line was disconnected and we did not have service.  I went to Suddenlink to get it fixed and they came out around a week later and replaced the cord.  Later that night, my internet went out again and we were wondering why.  I went outside and a neighbor whom I don't really communicate with said that whoever replaced my cable had also disconnected his line.  Thus, he rectified the problem by disconnecting my line an plugging his back in.  \n\nIs this a situation that I should get the police involved?  Given that he did not work for the company and had no right to do what he did, he was definitely in the wrong.  However, I am not entirely sure if this is illegal.  Would the police even be able to help in this situation?\n\n\nEdit (Update 1):  Bear with me because this might take a while.  After the confrontation with my neighbor, my girlfriend and I went to bed with plans to go to Suddenlink so that they might fix our internet again.  When I went to my vehicle in the morning, I found that someone had broken into both my car and my gf's car.  There didn't seem to be any signs of forced entry (we probably left our vehicles unlocked like some dummies) and nothing was stolen.  Obviously someone had gone through our stuff but did not take anything.  They did remove my backpack with library books and threw it into my front yard (if one can even call the grass in front of my apartment a \"yard\").  They didn't take anything out of the bag but did leave all of the zippers open.  We filed a police report and mentioned the altercation we had with our neighbors.  My gf thinks that the guy had broken into our car but I know that there are crazy people at our complex.  Plus, I wanted to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt.  However, I thought I should mention it to the police regardless. \n\nFlashforward to today.  The Suddenlink guy came out to fix our internet.  This time it was some other person who shall go nameless.  They fixed our internet and the box itself so that it locked properly.  After he left, our internet was back on.  About fifteen minutes later, it cut off completely.  Familiar with this problem, we went out to see if our neighbor had disconnected our line.  Sure enough, he had.  This time, he LITTERALLY cut our line.  We confronted him and he was obviously angry and even admitted to cutting the line.  He was pretty unkind to us and we decided to file a police report and call the company back (luckily the guy who worked on our box gave us his number).  The company has also filed a report with the police. The cable guy came back and fixed the problem, this time for good.  I have no idea if our neighbor's internet is out now and frankly do not care.  We have reported him to the police and our landlords as this is technically destruction of property, even if it is not our property.

{"prompt": "I just graduated high school, and my mother surprised me with a quilt that she had somebody make that was a collage of a bunch of my t shirts from different events. The idea is thoughtful and lovely, but the issue lies in the fact that she didn't ask before she raised my drawers. There are three shirts in there that I would have never in a million years wanted cut up and sewn into the blanket. Two are from a summer camp I attended for 8 years (I wore the shirts all the time and they had great memories attached to them) and one is from my freshman year jazz vocal festival. That was the first year I won an individual award for my solos and I was so so proud. It was the first time I felt like everybody saw me and recognized that I was good. I loved that shirt and the memories it carried. And now it's cut up and I can never take it to college or wear it again. Every time I look at the blanket I start crying. It's been a week and I still just tear up on sight. I know it's really dumb that I'm getting so upset but it's like the memories and the pride were destroyed too. She tried so hard to be thoughtful and I played off the initial tears as being overwhelmed by graduating and stuff (it was at my party) but I can't get it out of my head. I love her and I love that she put the effort into giving me something so personal but I'm so incredibly upset at the same time. I don't know if I should talk to her about it because there's nothing they can be done. I can't buy the shirts online because they were for the specific events. I'm just kind of stuck deciding between internalizing it and sucking it up or talking to her. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: Woahhhh this blew up way more than I was expecting. I really appreciate all of your input and I'm happy so many people took the time to offer advice! For people who say my mother might get angry if I said something: my reasoning for wanting to keep it from her is because I know how absolutely devastated she would be if she knew she had made me upset with this. She would probably feel arguably worse than I do about it and I don't want her to be so upset. To everybody saying it's probably better as a quilt and I'll learn to like it better that the shirts, you're probably right, I'll get there someday. Upon further introspection, I think some of my sadness stems from the fact that my senior year was half cancelled and I didn't get to go to the state festivals this year. So it was a combination of losing (altering, I guess) some of the treasured memories from high school and not being able to finish making them? I guess it all kind of hit me at once and made me more upset than I would have otherwise been. I don't think I am going to say anything because I know it wouldn't really make me feel any better and it would make her feel AWFUL. Maybe in the future I'll bring it up casually, but I think I'll be okay. Thank you to everybody who commented! (Also I'm kind of new to Reddit, how do I mark this as \"advice received?\")", "completion": "the exact same thing happened to me this Christmas. i love the blanket, it\u2019s so sweet. but there\u2019s so many shirts on there that hold sentimental value, which yes may be preserved through a blanket, but now i\u2019ll have no more pictures of me in them, or at those camps, festivals, etc. and i wore these on a regular basis, too.\n\nit\u2019s also a space thing. she took meaningful things from your space without your approval. it was in a thoughtful and well meaning way, but nonetheless.\n\nif i were you i\u2019d tell her basically: mom i really appreciate the blanket, and it may be a little silly but i\u2019m really upset about losing some of the shirts. i appreciate it, but i had to tell you to help myself."}
{"prompt": "So the last 24 hours has been rough. My mother just packed her things and left. The only reason I was aware is cause during my lunch break (I work from home at the moment) I caught her packing. I thought her and my dad were going on a trip so I asked where are they going. She just lied and told me she\u2019s not going anywhere. I clearly could see the suitcase she was packing and told her I can see what she is doing. At that point she closed the door and I was in shock so I went back to my workplace trying to process what I should do next. She eventually told my sister she was leaving to my aunt\u2019s home which is located in another state for the next 2 weeks. Honestly I wanted to tell her to stay but thought she might need some space because of an argument she had with my dad 3 weeks ago. So I didn\u2019t even ask any questions and she left in an Uber. My siblings and I were all shocked since this came out of nowhere and she typically lets us know if she plans on seeing her sister. And we didn\u2019t even know how we should break the news to dad.\n\nCome Saturday morning we find out she did not go with my aunt. We were frantic. We reached out to all her friends and her side of the family only to find out no one knew where she went. She must have turned off her phone because it would go straight to voice mail. It was one of the worst experiences of my life, not knowing if my mother was safe or where she was in the world. \n\nEventually a friend of hers was able to get in contact with her and let us know she was in a hotel and safe but that was all the information my mother was giving her. We still don\u2019t know where she is or even if she even plans on coming back. I feel awful because my gut told me to ask her to stay and I\u2019m hurt because I feel like she abandoned her family. I\u2019m 25F, with 4 siblings, 21F, 19F, 12F and 10M. So far the 2 younger ones believe she\u2019s with my aunt. My\nMother may not come back. I don\u2019t know how to explain the situation to them. Yes they\u2019re kids but the are not oblivious. They are already wondering why our mother hasn\u2019t called. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve discussed with my father cause he shut down once he heard she was okay BUT didn\u2019t want to talk to us. I need some advice on what I can do to help my family.\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for your kind words and just giving me a direction to head in. Right now we are keeping the kids distracted and luckily my Aunt was able to get in communication with my mother. So far she isn\u2019t talking to us but from what my aunt has updated me on, it seems like my mom will be headed over there. It\u2019s reassuring to know that my mom will be with someone she knows. Again thank you everyone for your advice!\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I just want to update this just in case someone passes through a similar situation. It\u2019s been a little over 2 weeks since my mom has left and I was able to visit her at my aunts house for 2 days since she\u2019s a few states away. We were able to talk and it turns out she was hiding a lot of stuff my dad had put her through. She finally reached her breaking point and did have a mental breakdown. She let me know her journey and honestly it\u2019s heartbreaking. Turns out she\u2019s been taking a lot of medication due to depression, anxiety and PTSD.\n\nShe\u2019s done with her marriage. Which I understand. My dad isn\u2019t a easy person to live with. My mom has been a stay at home mom for a long time so right now she wants to start working so she can try to get custody of the two little ones. Right now she\u2019s still broken and struggling to stand up on her own two feet since she is trying to get off the medication.\n\nI have a long journey ahead of me and so does my family. I can only hope that one day I\u2019ll be able to be with my mom again cause she means the world to me and it\u2019s been so hard living without her. As of right now my dad isn\u2019t aware she wants a divorce. She let me know that is a conversation they need to have and my mom just needs to figure out what to say. \n\nThank you everyone for your kind words.", "completion": "Wow this is so heartbreaking.  Sending big hugs your way.  This shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility, and I\u2019m so sorry that you are bearing the weight of this.  \n\nDo you know what they argued about that created such an extreme reaction?  Has she \u201cchecked out\u201d physically or emotionally from your family before?  I\u2019m wondering if she is going through something so shocking or heavy that she couldn\u2019t process it while also being in her normal routine life. Knowing that, and how her emotional state has been lately and historically, might give you a better idea of her mental state and her likelihood of returning.\n\nFirst thing I\u2019d do is talk to your dad.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s in shock and not handling it well, but it is his job to pull himself out of that and be there for his younger kids.  He doesn\u2019t get to check out and pretend nothing is happening, and he should be trying to make this situation have as little of a damaging impact on them as possible.  And if their fight led to this, he might have an idea if this is something more permanent or if she is just processing things.  His knowledge might help guide how this should be presented to your younger siblings.\n\nSecond, I\u2019d send your mom a message.  I\u2019d send it to any info you have, since I\u2019m guessing she still checks something that she has used in the past.  It\u2019s probably best not to guilt her, since she clearly has some shit going on and that might make her more likely to hide, but maybe just let her know how much you all love her and want to help her through whatever she is going through.\n\nAs for your siblings, that\u2019s where it gets harder.  Try to keep their routines intact.  Do things together as a family that are fun and bonding.  If they have to find out the truth, and if they have to face that she might not come back at all, they are going to have to deal with some very serious abandonment issues.  If your mom doesn\u2019t come back, they should be in therapy, a school counselor should check in with them often, and they may need more academic support.\n\nOnce you are out of the immediate crisis mode, you should talk with a counselor as well.  I know your first priority is what you can do for your family, but please also make sure you take care of yourself.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m so sorry that this is on you, and I\u2019m sending you strength and hope."}
{"prompt": "So, here it goes\n\n I have been great friends with a great gay friend (i'm 19M, she is 18F). Let's cal her Sue. She is the coolest person i know and i really feel like she was a person you meet once in a lifetime. The problem is, i have a really bad habit of running late and forgetting things, so i always ran late when we had to meet up and hang out. It wasn't a big deal when i ran late for like 10 minutes or something, but i used to be late for 30 minutes or more. But she forgave me. Every.  Fucking. Time. I don't know why i keep doing it, but i simply can't seem to manage my time. I procrastinate, i run late, i don't pay attention, i'm a hot mess if you will. Yet, apart from all that, she still forgave me. She was the best friend ever. \n\nNow, here's when i fucked up the most. Started college, met a girl (19F), let's call her Becky. I really like her, so we start talking, she played League with me, i asked her out, it was swell. Until one day, when she invited me to go to the mall with her. I say yes, of course, and go. The thing is, i had to meet with Sue the same day at 8 o'clock. So, i figure, i go at 7:30 there to meet up. The thing is... I forgot, completely. At 7:45 i get a call asking me if i'll make it on time. I say sure, but i kept staying with Becky cuz you know, i like her and shit. I get onto the bus at 7:50, and meet up wth Sue at fucking 8:45. \n\nPoor Sue had to wait for my fucking self for 50 goddamn minutes in the cold. I meet up with her, and I walk her home. This time it was different. She was understandably mad. We didn't talk, and halfway, she started to simply say: \"You know, I think you just don't care. I had a shit day, and was looking forward to meeting with you, but yet you had me wait for 50 fucking minutes\". I felt devastated. I really care about her, you know but yet, i still forgot, i still was an asshole. I thought with my dick instead of my brain.\n\nI feel like an asshole, like i'm the worst friend ever, and maybe i am.

{"prompt": "So about 2 months ago I was randomly drug tested at work and tested positive for weed. I was a daily smoker usually only to help me sleep and pain relief. Smoking for me was never about partying or abusing it. I only smoke by myself. I've worked for this company for over 2 years now and in good standings. Never once late for a shift, always productive and done my job correctly. There was no reason to believe that me smoking weed during my free time affected my work performance in any way.\n\nAfter the results of the random drug test comes back, hr informs me that I failed. I had 2 choices ; I could either be terminated or suspended until I can test clean and go through treatment. I decided for the suspension because I enjoy my job and I'm good at it. I knew it would take a while to get clean, but I was willing to go through it. It took about 40 days to start testing negative, so after waiting for the test to come back I lost about 6 weeks worth of pay. On top of that, I am currently attending these treatment classes every Tuesday for 3 hours to talk about our addictions. Most people in the class were addicted to hard drugs and/or alcohol. So I jump through all the hoops and get back to work as soon as the test come back negative. I have busted my ass trying to catch up with everything I've missed, and I have accomplished this within the week.\n\nThe very next week, HR sends a company wide email saying that they are no longer testing for weed with their pre employment or random drug testing. I can't imagine this is a coincidence that as soon as I get back they changed their policy. They know that I'm a good worker and they suspended me for no reason for such a long period of time. Do I have any grounds to demand some sort of back pay for the time I missed? Hr also told me that since I failed before the policy change that I have to continue treatment. I feel that this is completely unfair due to the timing of this policy change", "completion": "The timing sure is frustrating. But not much you can do. \n\nThe only thing you might have a case for is discontinuing the treatment. But HR has to follow their rules. \n\nAt least, once you\u2019re done, you don\u2019t have to worry about testing positive on randoms anymore. \n\nI would advise against lawyering up, unless you want to find a new job. If you bring a lawyer into the mix, your employer will most likely find a way to let you go once its all completed. No employer wants to keep an employee that has tried to sue them.\n\nAlso something to consider if you ever want to sue for wrongful termination. It will make it harder for you to find a future job. Someone who is quick to lawyer up is a risky hire. Not saying its right, just saying how it is."}

It was certainly a weird transition for us when we got back to that school.\n\nAt least you have the one friend though. One good friend can make a world of difference.

Is it really affecting your ability to play? If nothing else, my brother and I have started playing Dungeons and Dragons recently, which doesn\u2019t require pressing and buttons or anything physical really.

It's a really tough transition to go from the structure of academia to the no-structure of the real world. No one is there to tell you what to do our how you are progressing. Suddenly, you are the authority of your own existence, and if your whole identity in school was about being really good at reaching goals that other people set for you, it's the one thing you were never prepared for.

I'm not saying you should be happy living a life that feels pointless. Not at all. I'm saying that you will not be able to find what makes you feel fulfilled until you find a way to accept yourself exactly as you are. Believe that you are precious and worthy even when you accomplish nothing. Whenever you feel worthless, try to think of yourself at age 5. Was he worthless? Or does he deserve another chance? Will it help him grow if you yell at every time he makes a mistake? Or does he deserve comfort when he falls down and encouragement to get back up again?\n\nFrom this place, begin to ask yourself, what could I do today that would make me feel proud, that would make me feel like I contributed something good to the world? As hard as it is, try not to compare yourself to anyone else. You don't know the struggles that other people keep to themselves behind closed doors.

How? Is he in school now for a degree? I have to tell you when you were 16 and he was 22, he should not have been dating you or having sex with you. He was way too old. The reason older guys are attracted to younger girls is because they know they can manipulate them and they also know that the young girl, especially if she has no father involved, will view him as smart and worldly. Does he or ever did he involve himself in tutoring a boy? Did the father know your 26 year old BF was tutoring  his daughter and agreed with it? Or was it between them? It sounds very sketchy and I am glad the police are looking at him. Yes, you should be worried and yes, you should consider whether this is a relationship you want to be in."}

I saw how bad he felt during all this. My father isn\u2019t a bad parent or an aggressive father, normally he\u2018s so calm. That\u2019s why I respect him. I think this time he was just scared about my sister and started to randomly destroy everything near him, because my father is a very caring person and that\u2019s the first time I saw him freaking out. Anyways, after that he came in my room and we had a little talk alone without my sister or my mother.\n\nHe came in and said \u201eHoly shit, did I do this mess? My god...\u201c.

It helped me see grief from a different perspective, and I hope it will help you too.\n\n>Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.  \n>  \n>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.  \n>  \n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  \n>  \n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  \n>  \n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  \n>  \n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too.

The ER doc was bewildered that this happened and he called our doctor\u2019s personal phone to tell her what happened. She never contacted us to talk about it and did nothing to try remedy it.

{"prompt": "**TRIGGER WARNING: graphic discussion on child abuse, sexual assault, physical assault, emotional abuse, kidnapping.**\n\nX-posted to /r/legaladvice and /r/advice.\n\n**TL;DR as short as I can get it: On March 5th, 2020, I learned that my mother basically kidnapped me and my sister from our father around 1990-ish, drove us from Arizona to Kansas, and spent our childhood dodging his every attempt to be a father. My stepfather's son raped me for two years around 1987-ish, my stepfather sexually assaulted me (unknown for just how long) until I turned him in to the police in the summer of 1994. I didn't realize until 2010-ish that my mother not only knew about the abuse, she wanted to stay with my stepfather and she participated in the abuse. And now I've only just learned that, between 1984-ish to 1990-ish, my mother kept us from my father at all costs before kidnapping us and moving us from Arizona to Kansas. It is my belief that, had she never kept us from our father, I could have never endured all of the abuse I went through. I'm quite certain I have no legal recourse on the assaults because statute of limitations may have passed long ago. But do I have any options for legal justice? Prison time for my mother? A Lawsuit against my mother?**\n\nFollowing is the timeline of events that I now know:\n\n**Circa 1972:** My future birth mother met my future birth father. She wanted him so badly that she was willing to do anything to get him. So, she had her wealthy parents buy him a car to drive her around in and she did everything she could to trap and control him. My mother also started accusing my father of cheating on her. This accusation persisted throughout the full length of their relationship and it was deflection to cover up her cheating on him throughout their entire relationship.\n\n**1972:** My mother and father were 16 and got pregnant. They both had their parents grant them permission to get married at 16 and my mother's father arranged for them to go on their \"honeymoon\" to Florida. That honeymoon was a disguise for the abortion that my grandfather arranged and paid for. (I already knew most of this info, but not the part about my grandfather being involved or that it was disguised as their honeymoon.)\n\nAfter this, my mother moved from South Bend, Indiana, to the Phoenix, Arizona, metro with my father and his family (mother, adoptive father, and siblings). I am unclear on if she finished high school because she did want to drop out, but I think she gave up that idea and finished school.\n\n**1972-1982:** My mother and father lived a life of luxury bought and paid for by my mother's father. He bailed her out of every situation, as well as buying them houses, cars, and vacations, and making whatever arrangements she needed. Then, at some point around 1982, my mother demanded to have children. She fought and fought with my father and his family, telling them she had this perfect timeline of her life that she had lined out. They tried to convince her that it's going to be hard to transition from the carefree lifestyle to a family one, but she demanded. Apparently, she got everything she ever demanded.\n\n**March 1982:** My parents had me.\n\n**November 1984:** My parents had my little sister. My sister was apparently constantly crying, screaming, and thrashing as a baby, and my mother was always pissed that she wouldn't stop. It was at this time she began to scream at my father and tell him that his supposed drug use was the reason my sister wouldn't stop. My mother claimed my sister was going through \"withdrawals\" because she was no longer being fed drugs like she was in utero. (I think we all know the science doesn't back up my mother's claim and that any drug withdrawals my sister might have had would have been because her mother was abusing drugs while pregnant.)\n\nIt was sometime around 1984 that my mother began cheating on my father with the man who later became my stepfather. She had been accusing my father of cheating and he got tired of being accused for something he wasn't doing, so he figured he might as well cheat on her. He cheated with the woman who became his second wife and mother to his son.\n\nOne month after my parents' divorce was final, my mother married my stepfather \u2014 the man she'd been cheating on my father with. This entire timeline of events from before my sister was born to after my mother was remarried is still foggy. I know what happened, just not the particular order of when my mother got pregnant and when she met my stepfather.\n\n**1985-1990:** I have zero cohesive memories from this time in my life. There's flashes of things, but that's it. Flashes pertain to me being woken up in the middle of the night by one of my stepfather's much older sons who lived with us for two years and who raped me during that time. There's flashes of him making me hide in his closet at night or making me go to the bathroom with him. There's flashes of parents yelling, screaming, and physically fighting. There's flashes of my mother separating my older stepsister from my younger sister because she was inappropriately touching my little sister in the blanket forts we made. There's all these bad flashes, but there's absolutely no happy memories from this time.\n\nDuring the time, my father was supposed to see my little sister and me every other weekend. He was paying child support, doing everything he had to do by the court's order, and was trying to have a relationship with us kids. My mother continually fought him and told him he couldn't see us and we would conveniently not be home when it was my father's time to pick us up. This persisted for years, bringing my father to the decision to stop paying support for kids he never saw. My mother took him to court and he was forced to pay. So, after that, she proceeded to take him to court every year for more money. My father also apparently carried insurance on us.\n\n**1990(ish):** My mother and stepfather packed everything up and moved us from Arizona to Kansas without court approval or my father's knowledge. She just up and stole us, and he didn't find out until it was yet again another weekend he was supposed to have us. He showed up at the house and literally everything was gone and the house was for sale.\n\n**1992-1994(ish):** It was somewhere during this time that, according to my memory, my stepfather began sexually and physically assaulting me. He would make me shower with him. He would interrupt me running bath water and make me sit on his lap while I was naked and tell him about my day. My mother was even home plenty of times when this happened and I remember going to her for help many times, but every time I asked her to stop him she told me \"He's your father. He loves you. And he would never hurt you.\" When I took things into my own hands and started locking the bathroom door, my mother and stepfather would nearly beat the door down while screaming at me to unlock the door and let them in. Every single time I got scared enough and let them in, they would drag me to their bedroom, throw me on their bed, and proceed to \"spank\" me all up my back, across my butt, and down my thighs. I would be red, swollen, welted, and even bruised or bleeding on many, many occasions.\n\n**March 10th, 1994:** My older stepsister and I celebrated our birthdays together for the last time.\n\n**April 20th, 1994:** My older sister shot herself with her stepfather's gun. Years later one of her friends exposed that she had left a suicide note that explained why. She had been being raped by her father (my stepfather) as long as she could remember.\n\n**Summer 1994:** My stepfather sexually assaulted me while my mother was supposedly at work. He thought I was asleep. He came into my room naked. He knelt down by my bed. He pulled up my night shirt and pulled down my underwear. He assaulted me in ways he had never previously done before. While pretending to be asleep, my flight or fight response kicked in and I pretended like I was getting restless and was going to wake up. He freaked out, re-situated my clothes, left the room, and went into my little sister's room. I heard this, so I repeated my actions, but louder and even kicked our shared wall. He left her room, went into his room, got dressed, and went outside.\n\nIt was at this time that I woke my sister up and told her to get ready ASAP because we were going to leave. I tried calling my mother's work, doctor's office, friends, and anyone I could think of, but no one knew where she was. So, my sister and I ran over to the neighbors. I told the neighbors everything and they called the police for us. They even stayed with us at the sheriff's office the entire day because even the cops couldn't find my mother.\n\nBy the end of the day, they finally found my stepfather and mother. He had come back to the house and told the cops it was my friend Wendy's stepfather who sexually assaulted me, not him. That was 100% false because I visually identified him as he was leaving my room from the assault. As for my mother, she had been at a friend's house all day. (It wasn't until years later that those friends informed me that she had been confessing to them that she knew my stepfather was sexually assaulting me and that she should stop it, but she didn't want to risk losing the \"perfect life\" she created for herself.)\n\nThe police told my mother to file charges, get a protection order for us kids, and to divorce him. She told me she wasn't pressing charges against him because she \"didn't want to put me through the pain of a trial.\" (Again, she didn't want to leave him in the first place, so it came to me surprise that she didn't want to press charges. These days, the state would press charges regardless of how she felt.)\n\nAfter the final sexual assault \u2014 and as I was dealing with this while going through the confusion of puberty \u2014 my mother insisted that I sleep with her in her bed. I fought her. I didn't want to do this because it made me uncomfortable. What I wanted didn't matter and I was forced to sleep with my mother for some time. She would even spoon me and make me spoon her. I became her defacto husband.\n\n**1995-2000:** My mother spent years hitting me, grounding me, publicly humiliating me, kicking me out of my house and changing the locks, and then forcing me to move back home for more torment. During this time I lived at 1) a local hospital's mental unit, 2) United Methodist Youthful Center (once a home for abandoned and homeless kids), 3) neighbors, 4) my mother's parents' house, 5) my birth father's (who my mother had spent my life convincing me that he was the bad guy in all of this), 6) a friend's house, and 7) a boyfriend's grandparents' house.\n\nIt was during this time that I was cutting myself, drinking, smoking, doing drugs, and letting boyfriends do whatever they wanted to my body on public display because it was all I believed I was good for. I spent every day wishing I was dead, but unable to do it myself. I wanted someone, anyone to kill me. I didn't care what happened before or after, I just wanted them to end my suffering.\n\n**2000-2007(ish):** I tried desperately to have a relationship with my mother, thinking that maybe she would want and love me now that I wasn't the awful child she told me I was. Nothing worked and I spent these years beating myself up for being a failure who couldn't even get her own mother to love her.\n\nTowards the end of this timeframe, I finally realized I could never satisfy my mother because it wasn't me that was broken, it was her. (Though, I was not convinced I wasn't a bad person. Decades of gaslighting me led me to firmly believe I was, am, and always will be broken.) I cut my mother out of my life and started to try heal.\n\n**2019-2020:** I've been in therapy with the most incredible therapist I could ever imagine. She has truly helped me get on a path of self-healing which I'm certain will eventually lead to self-acceptance and self-love. But all of this takes a lot of time and a lot of hard work. Some days it's too much.\n\n**March 2nd-5th, 2020:** I learned just how evil my mother was, is, and always has been. Gaps in my life were finally starting to be filled in with stories that fit the profile I had for my mother. Questions that had always been unanswered were starting to get answers. I was thrilled and excited because I was finally, for the first time in my life, being validated and vindicated.\n\n**March 6th-12th, 2020:** All of the new information collapsed in on me. I suddenly realized that I could have never endured all that abuse and pain if only she never kidnapped me. That's the part that been killing me.\n\n**March 13th, 2020-Present Day:** I am stabilizing.

This is new information. The statute of limitations couldn't possibly be expired on new information, right?**\n\n**So, please, I'm begging you. Is there is a way to find justice?

{"prompt": "So I recently stumbled upon my ex best friend\u2019s TikTok video on my for you page. She started telling this story about how she used to have a best friend (me) that would constantly breakup and get back together with guys. She said that I was so obsessed with one, that he had to come out as gay so that he could \u201cget rid of me\u201d since I \u201cthreatened to kill myself, call the cops on him, and put him in jail\u201d if he didn\u2019t get back together with me. She said that our \u201crelationship finally ended when he came out as gay.\u201d\n\nI know that the story is about me, because my ex did come out as gay in high school, but as a joke to mess with me (he later on admitted it to me). By the time that he had came out as \u201cgay\u201d, I was already in a new relationship so I was nothing but surprised and supportive when I first heard about the news. I have tons of proof and concrete evidence that would debunk her story about me. \n\nMy ex\u2019s current girlfriend, reached out to my ex best friend because she saw the TikTok video she made about me. My ex friend then made a follow up video saying that she talked to his new girlfriend on the phone for hours, and was getting the \u201ctea on me\u201d.  She said she found out that \u201cI was a stalker that would randomly show up at his house when he wasn\u2019t home, and that I installed Snapchat on his phone so that I could track his location without him knowing.\u201d We dated from 2012-2015, and snap maps didn\u2019t come out until 2017. So idk how I was possibly tracking his location on Snapchat back then?? \n\nShe didn\u2019t name me in the video, but it genuinely hurt me to see someone whom I used to call by true best friend tell fake stories about me in order to gain more followers. I reached out to her, explained how the stories aren\u2019t true, and politely asked if she could take down the videos. Of course she ignored me. All of the comments are saying that \u201cI\u2019m psycho\u201d, and \u201cgive off Jodi Arias vibes\u201d. \n\nI want to defend myself, but I\u2019ve never made a TikTok video in my life, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to even expose her and her lies.", "completion": "Just ignore her. Since she never names you it doesn\u2019t really affect you. How would anyone know who she\u2019s talking about?\n\nIf her actions do somehow ruin your reputation you might want to speak to a lawyer and possibly sue for defamation. Just the threat of legal action could get her to stop.\n\nEdit: the hate isn\u2019t directed towards you, rather it\u2019s towards the \u201cpsycho\u201d character she\u2019s made up, so don\u2019t feel too bad about that."}
{"prompt": "Me (19M) and my dad (52M) live together in a condo. My mom (53F) and him are separated, if that matters.\n\nFor context, here is how our living room in the condo is set up: both my dad's and my PC setups are in the living room, facing toward opposing walls.\n\nAnyway, I come home to the condo after a doctor's appointment. I go and sit down at my desk as usual. My dad and I are conversing about my appointment, just usual casual talk. While we're talking, he looks away casually to look at the kitchen (away from the living room), and I look away at the same time at his computer screen. He already has a bad habit of keeping applications open on his computer, even when he is away or asleep.\n\nAt a glance, I see pornography. I personally don't think much of it, because it isn't a crime to have porn. The man is single, so hey, everyone needs to get off sometimes. However, it did look strange. It was a paused video on an MP4 player, in a small window on his computer. He has other windows open too, but it's just normal casual Youtube stuff.\n\nI don't think he noticed that I saw what was on his screen. In fact, I don't even think he knew it was on his screen. He probably thought he closed it earlier or something.\n\nHe says he's going to get ready to play pool, so he goes to his room and the bathroom. While he's away,  I take a closer look at what's on his screen, and sure enough... it's of a little boy. Like no debate, it is of an underage child.\n\nI wanted to throw up and cry, I didn't think he would do anything like this. If there's one file, there's more on his hard drive for sure, right?\n\nI needed to play it off that I never noticed, once he comes back and tells me he's leaving to go play pool. So I hop on a game on my own computer to make it seem like I was too distracted by my own gaming to even notice what's on his computer screen across the room behind me. About 20 minutes later, he comes out, turns off his computer, and says he's leaving, all while I'm playing the game. It seems that it worked.\n\nI told my mother about what happened. I'm staying at my mom's place now. She seems to have the perspective about how to keep the family together, but I personally think this is already past a family matter. This isn't a victimless crime. I don't even know how long this has been going on. He's always been a good father to me, but I feel so disgusted. Has he ever looked at me the same way he looks at those little boys? How does he even acquire this stuff?\n\nWhat should I do? Should I file an anonymous claim? Should I confront him? Tell him to seek help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy girlfriend (19F) comes over on the weekends sometimes, and she prefers staying at my dad's condo than my mom's house, as there's more to do. I haven't told her anything about what I discovered about my father. I don't feel comfortable bringing her to the condo, especially if she's sleeping over. What should I tell her, if anything?\n\nAlso, my dad's own father has a history of pedophilia as well. My dad grew up to hate and despise him, as he abused and molested his own children. I feel that my dad, who knows well how child abuse and pedophilia can ruin a family, should know so much better than to do this.", "completion": "report him anonymously. Stay at your moms.

I don\u2019t want children and we aren\u2019t in a financial place to have one.\u201d\nMy bfs mom started crying and there was a lot of yelling back and forth about it.\n\nI finally said \u201cit\u2019s my body so I have the final say.

{"prompt": "Hello! I really need some help.\n\nI was informed this morning, pictures of me (specifically images only shown to friends and former friends of mine) are being used on a really sketchy website are being used for a profile on a sex chat website.\n\nI am 14 years old, and the page says I'm 21. I didn't even make it.\n\nIt also says that I'm \"In constant need of good cock\" in the profile on the website's bio- despite me literally being a child.\n\nI think I might know who have done it. My boyfriend had this really toxic friend. This guy, we'll call him L, would do horrible things to him. L would constantly insult his and I's relationship, would make fun of my boyfriend's appearance and interests, and would do stuff like photoshop my boyfriend into images of Hitler. Eventually, after me and my boyfriend had a talk about how he was being used by L, my boyfriend cut ties with him completely. L thinks because of this that I'm, in his own words, a \"Manipulative whore\". L is 15 or 16.\n\nWhat do I do? Should I keep evidence for law enforcement? I feel like if my mom knew this is happening, she wouldn't let me show my face online (Which for me helps with my low self confidence).\n\nIs there any specific authorities to contact, should I just ignore it? It doesn't use my real name, and nobody online except my boyfriend knows my full name- and he hasn't shared it.\n\nPlease Reddit, what do I do? I need help. I don't want this to ruin my future jobs because employers might think its me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Firstly, thank you for all of the support. I don't check reddit often but coming back to this made me cry a little. I was able to get the images down without telling my mom or the cops. Firstly I contacted all the people who had that picture of my face that was being used (only some people have seen it) and I told them if it wasn't down I would take legal action. Simultaneously, I found the sites owners and took the advice of making a sockpuppet email, taking the advice someone gave me to write as an infuriated parent. I threatened legal action against the site, which I'm surprise this did anything seeing as it seems to be based in India. Right after I contacted those people, they changed the profile picture on the website to some random anime loli (ew). And about two days later, the account was banned from the site. Thank you all so much for the kind words and advice. I don't know what I would do without this advice, seeing as (partially due to my autism) I was scared and panicked and felt myself shutting down whenever I thought about it. I don't know who specifically did it still, but my boyfriend and I have cut ties with the group of assholes (L and his friends) that were most likely responsible. Him and I are doing wonderfully, and our 11 month anniversary is on the 30th. He's been more happy and carefree now that he's away from those dickheads- and I don't care if they think I'm manipulative. I know that keeping them away from him is what's best for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of you seem to think the pictures were pornographic in nature for some reason?? They were not.

{"prompt": "My father is the worst person I know. He still comes around us because me and my mom are scared of doing anything, even calling the police.

Every person we talk to says the same thing, if he's so awful just call the police. It's not that simple, at least it doesn't feel that simple. We're both worried that he'd shoot the police, and even when they've gotten involved they've never been of any help, saying not to call unless he is in our apartment.\n\nToday he came through the door in a bitchy mood as always, yelling about how much he needs my help to fix up his house but that I never go there. I never go to his house because he'll make me feel miserable the entire time. He also asked me to check and see if he was getting his stimulus check. I told him I needed his email, something he never checks and doesn't know how to check. I look and see an email from a month ago saying he was rejected and needed to reapply. He immediately blames me, saying I must've purposely filled it out wrong just to spite him. That's when it all started.\n\nI started to yell back, saying that I filled out the form the same way I filled out mine. He starts getting in my face, and saying \"You wanna fight, let's take it outside\". We continue screaming back and forth, until he decides he's gonna leave. As he's walking out the door he's popping off more shit about how sorry I am, and I guess I just snap. I remember grabbing him by the throat and throwing him to the ground. I even remember after he went limp I still kept strangling him and screaming \"DIE MOTHER FUCKER! DIE! DIE!\" over and over again. I opened the door and started dragging him outside, his head hitting the concrete as I did.\n\nFinally after a bit he woke up, his face was bleeding and he kept asking us what happened. I kept screaming at him \"You opened up your smart mouth for the last fucking time!\", and other stuff. I ran out to the back porch and started to try and calm down. My hands wouldn't stop shaking, and I started to cry. I had completely lost it, and if I hadn't of let go when I did I may have killed him. I'm going to see my counselor tomorrow and talk to him about this, I feel so awful and scared that I was close to going too far. I hate him so much, I just wish he'd leave us alone. But with how stupid and stubborn he is he'll probably show back up in a few days and act like nothing ever happened. What should I do?

{"prompt": "I remember when I was a teenager, just a picture of a naked Pam Anderson was enough to get me going for days. The fact that she had big fake canonball tits didn't bother me at all. Nothing really did. Everything was exciting.\n\nBut as the years have gone on, I find I am impressed less and less. This has likely been exacerbated by my training and job as a doctor. I have now over the past 10 years seen and done things medically to so many people that likely go beyond the scope of what any normal person outside of my field or perhaps a sex worker would experience in their life span.\n\nThis goes for both men and women's bodies. \n\nThere was a time giving a rectal/prostate exam to a man would make me mildly uncomfortable. Now I've stuck my finger in so many people's asses of both genders it's pretty much a completely neutral experience. Not much different than listening to a heartbeat.\n\nI've seen thousands of people in various states of undress. \n\nI've done countless manual pelvic exams on women to feel for pelvic muscle dysfunction, infections, cervix abnormalities, and ovarian masses. I've done so many speculum exams for paps I couldn't begin to count. Ditto with breast exams.\n\nI know what the spectrum of human anatomy looks and feels like inside and out from birth to 90 years old and everywhere between.\n\nI know people would probably like to believe this isn't the case,  but when you start out in this type of field you're not machine-like. There was a time even the notion of doing a breast exam made my heart beat a bit faster. The first pap I did my heart was pounding so much just from nervousness and also I hadn't really seen many women naked at all at that time. Now it's literally just tissue to be sorted through and analyzed. The only nervousness I have now is if I will be making the person I'm examining uncomfortable or not.\n\nThe neutralization of the body in my mind probably makes me more ideal as a doctor. Most people would like a doctor who sees them as a neutral body. But I think it's changing my perspective on dating and sex too. Porn has become boring. Masturbation is boring. Dating is boring.\n\nI was out at a club grinding with a girl and while my dick got hard from it, that was really just an involuntary response. I didn't really actually care the whole time. I kept thinking she needed to lose 10 lb as I felt her hips because (1) all I do all day is try to find and analyze physical flaws and what people can do to be healthier and (2) I've seen and been around so much it's almost impossible for anyone to really be impressive to me physically.\n\nI remember when I was a resident working in a breast clinic, one of the husbands of a patient made a joking comment about how it must be an amazing job to just feel up women's breasts all day. I think that's how other men might see it. But that's not the reality at this point. For example, I calculated and I will have to do over 40 hours of paps (which often also include a breast exam as that is the most opportune time to screen both) in the next 2-3 months to catch up my patient population for the year. It's literally just a chore that will eat into the rest of my schedule and it's going to be a grind to get them all booked in and done.\n\nHow do you get excited about sex or dating when the human body has literally become just a chore to you?\n\nIt seems to me like you can't have it both ways. If the human body is exciting and new then you're not the objective and neutral doctor people want. And once you've seen so much it becomes boring then how do you excited about it again?\n\nI guess maybe this is just an inevitable change that occurs from doing this sort of thing. I really don't know. I just know it's hard to get excited about dating or sex when almost nothing excites you anymore. I kind of miss the days when the body was an exciting and uneasy thing. That uneasiness is where sexual tension, fantasy, and desire comes from.\n\nHow do you have those things once the mystery is pretty much completely gone?", "completion": "This is actually very comforting.\n\n  \nI had a new doctor once and had to show him an itch on my anus.  \nI cannot tell you how embarrassed I felt. \n\nHe of course, didn't seem to care and told me he'd seen a couple thousand anuses before.  \nI hadn't shown my anus to anyone before."}

I suggest you continue to romantic intimacy without the expectation of sex for a time while she is working on what she is working on.\n\nIf in the future you feel a real problem with your Mental Health then you could consider it again. But my advice is to lay that pass down and never pick it up. When you feel strongly enough that you want to have sex with another woman it may be time to make other arrangements."}
{"prompt": "I walked in on my cousin and my brother making out. I\u2018m 14, my brother is 15 and my cousin is 16 (all male). We\u2019ve been close since childhood, always running around together and playing video games, yk, what kids do. In the past year I\u2019ve noticed them getting closer, but ofc just thought they were bonding so I didn\u2019t really suspect anything. Two days ago we all met at our yearly family gathering, it was really fun and I got to see a lot of people that I missed. My brother, my cousin and I decided that we want to stay at my grandparents house for a few more days so that we can hang out because we don\u2019t see each other that much anymore. Yesterday, i went out for a little to get food from the store across the street. It took me a bit longer because we eat a LOT of snacks and it was like shopping for a family of 5. When I came back after around an hour or so I noticed it was quiet, which is very weird for us since we\u2019re all very loud. I walked upstairs to the bedroom we shared to figure out why and when I opened the door my brother was on top on my cousin and they were making out. Like heavily making out. My brother wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt and his hands were all over my cousin. I just kinda froze and they jumped apart. My cousin started crying and my brother instantly comforted him, he himself also tearing up. I awkwardly stood before walking out. I just kinda sat on the porch for a bit, processing what just happened. My brother came out of the house and we awkwardly sat in silence for a while before he spoke up. He said \u201cI know it\u2019s weird but me and [name] really love each other. I\u2019m sorry you found out this way.\u201d And walked off. It\u2019s been really awkward and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t really know how I feel about it either. I, for one, didn\u2019t know either of them were gay. I\u2019m in no way homophobic, my girlfriend is bi and I have a lot of gay friends who I support fully, although I am straight (I think). But secondly, we are literally related. Our dads are brothers, and I see both of them as brothers. I mean they\u2019re happy, but yet again oh my god. Im definitely not going to tell anyone in our family, I don\u2019t want to ruin their relationship even if it\u2019s a bit weird. But I also don\u2019t know, I feel like our relationship isn\u2019t going to be the same, and I kinda don\u2019t want to be that close to them anymore, which makes me feel bad. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: I talked to them earlier and we had a long discussion about it. I told them that I do support them being gay, but I\u2019m not sure about their relationship. They said they understood and I asked for a bit of space. I also promised them that I won\u2019t tell an adult, or anyone I know irl for that matter. I asked how long they had been a thing and they said 11 months, so it\u2019s been going on a for a bit. I told them I was happy that they found love but am slightly weirded out. Im currently not talking to either for them for at least a few days and just taking my time to think, Ty for the advice!\n\nAlso, for all the people assuming I\u2019m in the US and stuff, I\u2019m German, live there and all this is happening in Germany.

Also, How can I move out without hurting their feelings? Cause I still want them in my life. To give some background on how controlling they are, here's some..reason?...\n\nI can only text 1 friend, I've known her since 1st grade. I love her so much, but I have more than 1 friend.\n\nWe have an \"open door\" policy. I can't shut my door unless I'm getting out of the shower. Otherwise, No privacy. EVER. \n\nMy parents told me I would be allowed to date at 16, now that I'm sixteen and want to reach out to my crush, all of a sudden my dad actually told me \"When you're 18 you can start dating\" Obviously that rule hasn't stopped me, My crush (boyfriend actually) have been together for almost 4 years. \n\nI can't take walks, let alone walk around the block or ride my bike. I can't be in our front yard, and I have to ask if I want to go into the backyard. \n\nWe have a phone turn-in. And it's at 10, and I have TONS of child locks on my phone. I have a time limit on all my apps and my parents constantly go through my phone. I'm not allowed to have any social medias, I can only have youtube.\n\nOf course there is a lot more. But my parents are also very toxic to me. About a week ago, I was having a bit of an attitude. That's on me. I was being mouthy. But the fact that my dad got in my face, spat and me and yelled at me is what's toxic. The fact that they both threatened to kick me out, is what makes me want to leave.

Place to sleep, food, hygiene, this can be either living from your car, buying grocery store meals and showering at the local gym or staying at a friends/ extended family house. If your home is bad enough, try and see if you can join a homeless of women's shelter till you've got a job.\n\nOnce you get a roof above your head, you'll need a job to continue having a roof above your head and save money for your own space. This will be hard, especially while shutting off your parents at the same time and it's up to you to see if the situation requires this. There isn't really a quick and easy solution. Focus on getting housing, money is just an easier way to get and keep housing. Buying a car might be an easier short term solution  \n\n\ntl;dr you need to find a way to save money, or be able to live somewhere rent-free till you can make money"}

{"prompt": "As you guys suggested, I\u2019m gonna try to get her back. [Please look at this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/clzgkk/update_my_mom_sold_my_dog_against_my_will_and_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) \n\n\n[SMALL UPDATE BELOW]\n\nI\u2019m 16yo, male.\nI had an amazing, very well behaved one year old Akita dog that I spent basically the whole day with...she was pretty protective of me, and she was large. Although she was an angel with amazing behavior, and whenever my family came to interact with her, she was pretty nice although they didn\u2019t stick around much...only interacting with her for a few minutes before leaving, I was basically the only person taking care of her, but I loved it, and I loved her.\n\nThen my mom told me she wants to sell my dog. She said it was way too large and scary looking and she wanted a dog that \u201ccould be compared to a cat, and treated like one\u201d.  I had no choice in the matter and a week later, my dog was gone. A lady came to pick her up and I had the task of crating her and such...I put my dog in the lady\u2019s car, and she and my mom went inside to discuss some stuff. I ran to the kitchen and got some boiled chicken, the treat I usually give her. I sat in the ladys car with my dog for a bit, giving her plenty of chicken and petting her with my fingers through the bars of the crate, so she wouldn\u2019t be scared on the car ride as much...\n\n\nThen, when mom and the lady came back and the lady drove off, my dog was gone.\nI didn\u2019t really feel anything. I was just kinda like...I guess another dog it is...\n\nA week passed, and I was actively just waiting for a new dog. It felt so weird not having anything to take care of. Of course, I did miss my dog...but I didn\u2019t feel sad, I was just feeling \u201cvoid\u201d, nothing. If that makes sense.\n\nMom came home with a new three month old small puppy, a white terrier. About a week has passed since I owned him, and I\u2019m his primary caretaker.  Of course, I love him and he\u2019s been a sweetheart, although needing a lot of training that I\u2019m working on at the moment..but my family has been wanting him with them a lot more than my old dog. They sometimes come to me and tell me to leave the dog with them for a bit, all of my family call him cute when he does certain things. He\u2019s...scarily similar to my Akita dog in the way he acts. But instead of freezing up or being indifferent to his actions like they were with my Akita, they call him cute n stuff...even though he\u2019s acting very similarly to my old Akita, he\u2019s just small and non-threatening I guess. But I would get this very irriater feeling in my gut when I see how my family treats this dog so differently even when my Akita did the same thing...you know, jumping in excitement, micro borks when playing, running around excitedly, being happy to see me, standing, dog stuff. \n\nThe more time I spent with this dog, the more he just kept reminding me of my Akita. I\u2019ve been getting more and more depressed just thinking ahout it while I\u2019m taking care of him since he reminds me so much of her...\n\n\nOne day, I was trying to get my new dog to sleep. I was in my room and he was on his bed, but he was being very anxious and hasn\u2019t slept well. I was determined to make him sleep at least a little that day. I knew he trusted me, so I just did some stuff. Played relaxing music, sat with him silently while he slept, comforted him, a lot of stuff. Still, though, he\u2019d suddenly jerk awake every 15 minutes or so at the slightest sound, and then he would see me, I\u2019d pet him and he\u2019d almost immediately plop down to sleep. This kept reminding me when I was doing the same thing to my Akita dog when she was anxious and didn\u2019t sleep at all for a whole day almost...She was waking up at each sound, just like this new dog was, and the way I was treating this new dog to get him to sleep was exactly what I did to my Akita. \n\n\nSo I was theee, literally just sitting there in silence making sure he actually gets to sleep. He\u2019d wake up every 15 minutes. All the while, I\u2019m silently just...being reminded of my Akita. I was holding back tears though, because I had to be silent for my dog to sleep.\nBut...he never did. He kept jerking awake every 15 minutes. After about an hour and a half of this, my dog jerked awake one final time. It gave me flashbacks to when my Akita did the same thing. After I tended to him and got him sleeping again, as soon as he laid down and closed his eyes, It was too much. I was remembering my Akita too much. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and started crying. Apparently it was LOUD. I didn\u2019t even realize, but according to my mother, she heard it from the second floor when she came to check on me. I thought nobody would be able to hear me even outside my door, but apparently I was crying extremely uncontrollably. I didn\u2019t tell my mom why I cried, though.\n\nI have the number of the lady who had my dog, and I called her every now and then to ask how my Akita was...she never answered. It always times out. My mother is refusing to give me any details and just says she has her and she\u2019s fine. What the hell do I do? I love my new dog yes, but I\u2019m such a wreck right now...I can\u2019t even interact with my new dog for a long time because I just remember my Akita, get depressed  and feel like crying. Thankfully, others are happy to take him off my hands temporarily whenever I need a break...though, they\u2019re the one asking me to take him for a bit.\n\nI just don\u2019t know. What do I do?\n\n\n[UPDATE]\n\n\nA lot has happened in these two hours, actually.\n\nYesterday I asked my mom why the person who bought my dog wasn\u2019t responding, she hesistated for 3 seconds and said she re-sold sold the dog and she forgot to told me. I didn\u2019t believe her.\nThe reason I was calling the person who bought my dog was because she said I could visit her and ask her for updates. I also had a mini interview with her about how she\u2019d treat the dog, and she came out fine. Though, I just called her for the second time today, and she finally responded. She did confirm that she sold my dog. When I asked her if that meant I couldn\u2019t visit, she said \u201cObviously. I don\u2019t know where she is\u201d.  I continued that conversation a bit talking about how I should have made it clear in our agreement that I would get to visit her, and that it was my bad that I didn\u2019t specify.\n\n\nLater, my mom called me. She asked me why I called TPWBMD. I told her I just wanted to know what was up for sure. She explained to me that she told me everything yesterday and that TPWBMD said I was bothering her by calling constantly. She also said that this made her look like a bad mother because now TPWBMD thinks my mom didn\u2019t tell me about what she did to my dog, which she didn\u2019t until I explicitly asked her.\n\nAfter that, I kinda hatched a plan. I called our vet and pretended that I somehow lost the microchip digits of my dog, and if they could tell me the code so I could write it down in her dog passport. They asked me if I had the dog, I lied and said yes. They said I can just bring her in and they\u2019d scan and give me the code. I pretended that I was too lazy to, and said if it was possible if I provided details.\n\nAfter confirming my name, phone number, my dogs name, breed, etc, they knew I was the guy with her at the vet for sure. After 30 minutes, I was told the tracking chip code.\n\nI went all over the internet looking for the contact info of the new owner of my dog. It seems it doesn\u2019t exist. I think I have to wait until the guy who newly owns her puts his info on the tracking chip, then I can input that into some website and I\u2019ll get his contact info and maybe he will agree to update me on my Akita regularly. Or hell...maybe visit? I wish with all my heart this goes well.", "completion": "I kind of hate your Mom. It made me so mad to read this.

{"prompt": "So here\u2019s the story. When I was 17 my uncle started messaging me online and responding to my photos, he\u2019d send me fire emojis and heart eyes. I thought this was weird and spoke to my mom about it who then told me not to worry. On my 18th birthday he told me he was so happy I was 18, but again, I thought nothing of it because my mom told me not to. For the next year it continued with him sending me emojis and I\u2019d reply because, well, he\u2019s my uncle.\n\nThen one day he got ahold of my Snapchat and as weird as I thought it was, I accepted his request. He\u2019d send me regular snapchats of his day-to-day life and I would typically reply with smiley face emojis, never really starting up conversation because I just felt as though something was off.\n\nFlash forward, I got my first nude. I skipped through the Snapchat so quickly that I convinced myself I had imagined it. Then came the videos. Disgusting videos of him touching himself and moaning my name. I went to my mom and (not surprising considering my family) she didn\u2019t believe me and said I would need proof before she believed me.\n\nI screenshotted all of the photos he sent to me that very night and showed my mom, who made excuse after excuse about how somebody must have photoshopped the photo and was pretending to be my uncle. When I convinced her it was real, she told my aunt and the two went to confront him. I don\u2019t know what happened the night they both confronted him but my mom came home that night telling me that I needed to forgive him and move on because he is family, and it wasn\u2019t as if he touched me or raped me.\n\nThis weekend is Easter, and although I have not had too much contact with my family since the incident, they expect me to be there for Easter. They have invited my uncle and it disgusts me. I do not want to see him however, although I do not live with my mom she helps support me when I can\u2019t afford my bills and I\u2019m afraid she will stop if I don\u2019t show up to Easter. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI also don\u2019t know what can be done about my uncle seeing as I was 18 when the photos were sent to me.

With no evidence of injury right now you might struggle to get it responded to but if it happens again, start making sure it\u2019s known outside your household.\n\nIn general, if you know your parents are lying about something, then you may find it\u2019s not worth arguing. You know they are, they know they are, what do you get from the debate on the point? Nothing at all. Don\u2019t keep picking at it if your end goal is something that won\u2019t happen, like \u201cthey admit they were lying to me and apologise\u201d. A row won\u2019t make that likely and it won\u2019t make anyone feel better.

Dont use to much soap, its hard to get out. Rinse your clothes and lay them anywhere to dry. You can shower and whatever in any truckstop. As far as food. Eat, hoard and store all the food you find. Try to get you a big thing of peanut butter. Its huge in proteins and will fill you up fast! Any chicken is very filling and full of protein.   People will always help just learn who to talk to. Old ladies will help you =)  If you were to ask me for anything you would leave with what i can give you from my home or wallet.

He just wanted to get his point across and I am stubborn and head strong and that\u2019s the only way he thought to get me to understand how I dress really was important to him.

{"prompt": "To say I was mad as hell would be an understatement. I (46M) have a son Jake (23M & Fake Name). Jake was a good kid growing up. So him doing this was a complete shock to me. I have a daughter too, Amber (16F & Also Fake Name). When my wife passed away from Covid nearly two years ago, she already had a will in place. She was immunocompromised due to a prior condition she was diagnosed with a decade before she passed. And she made sure she had a will set just in case anything happened to her. And in said will she divided her assets between our children. And Jake got his cut as he was already 21. He used that money to put a down payment on a condo, and he also got his mother's car. But the will stated that my daughter was to get all of my wife's jewelry. That included a vintage gold ring with a diamond that had a light blue sapphire on each side of it. That ring has been passed down for generations in my wife's family. It was originally her grandmother's wedding band. Her husband was a jeweler and hand crafted the ring for her himself. And it was passed down to my wife's mother when her grandmother died, and then to my wife herself when her mother passed. And it along with the other jewelry was to all go to my daughter.\n\nWhen my wife passed away, my grief was intense. But I powered through it for the sake of my family. And they supported me 100%. So the betrayal from my son was just a rusty knife in the back to me. For the past eight months Jake has been dating Sara (Fake name). She has my son wrapped around her finger. And she loves jewelry as she adorns herself with it a lot. My son mentioned the family jewels my wife left his sister to Sara one day, and Sara really wanted to see them. So Jake went into my room when no one was home and showed them to her. He later admitted to me that he'd done this, and I was angry. But I thought that would be the end of it. I was wrong. Jake came to me a week ago and begged for that ring from his mother's family jewels so that he could propose with it. He said Sara had fallen in love with the ring when she saw it before, and he just knew it'd be the perfect ring to ask her to marry him with. He seemed completely convinced I'd be jumping for joy for him wanting to propose. But instead, I told him that I was not the one to ask as the ring belongs to Amber. And I wouldn't have him pressuring her to give it up it either. For a fair chance, I'd allow him to explain his reasons and ask her for it once. But only once. Without pressuring her. And if she refuses for any reason, that will be the end of it. Jake agreed and asked Amber for the ring right in front of me. But she told him no because she wanted to keep it in the family jewels, and has always loved that ring. To her, it's priceless. She couldn't bear to ever give it up. I told Jake that was that, and to not press the matter further.\n\nJake left looking very unhappy about not getting the ring. But I thought he'd let it go and look into finding a similar one. But he came back another day while I was at work to talk to his sister after she got home from school. He and Amber got into a huge fight about the ring and Amber called me crying. I called Jake and told him to get out of my house and leave his sister alone. Jake yelled at me that he should have just as much right to the ring as his sister, because my wife was his mother too. But I reminded him he got a lot of his mother's money, and her car. The jewelry is Amber's, and only hers. He hung up on me and Amber soon texted me that he left very angry.\n\nLater right before I left work, my daughter called and told me that Jake came back. He walked in dressed in a suit, went into my room and took something. Then left without saying anything to Amber. She tried to keep him from leaving, but he shoved her out of the way. I rushed home as soon as my shift was over and checked my wife's jewelry box. The ring was gone. I immediately called Jake, but he didn't answer. So I messaged him that I'll get police involved if he doesn't return the ring. Using it to propose won't stop me from taking it back. That finally made him talk to me, and he tried to say that I couldn't do that to him because he's my son. I said I can and will because he outright stole the ring. And he'd better bring it back right away, or I would take drastic measures. Well he phoned me right after that, and in a whisper he said that it was too late. He'd taken his girlfriend out to dinner and proposed to her with the ring. He hadn't had it for more than an hour by this point. Yet the ring was already on her finger. I said that was his problem. He stole the ring, he can bring it back. It's not his, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure it's returned. And if that means going to police and blowing the whole situation up, then so be it. I'll file a report, I'll even get a lawyer. Jake started crying and saying I couldn't do this to him. I told him tough luck. He stole from both his sister and dead mother. I would not back down until the ring was returned.\n\nJake wouldn't stop crying and making excuses. So I told him to have the ring back by morning, or I would be moving forward with legal action. Jake is my son, but he still broke the law. And I couldn't overlook what he did. He said he'd be by in the morning to talk, and ended the call while crying even more. Well Jake did show up in the morning, and brought his girlfriend with him to try and guilt us. Turns out she not only knew he stole the ring, she wanted to keep it anyway. Because she was completely in love with the ring since she first laid eyes on it. I told her I didn't care. She could have a jeweler make a copy of it or something. But the original doesn't belong to her, it belongs to my daughter and deceased wife. Jake begged me one more time not to make her give it back. But I and my daughter stood firm. Return the ring or face police and maybe even a potential lawsuit. Jake's girlfriend pulled the ring off her finger and dropped it in my daughter's hands, called me an evil bastard, then left my house in tears. Jake started screaming at me that I may have just destroyed his relationship. I retorted him that he did this to his own relationship by stealing a ring that didn't belong to him. What kind of son steals from his own sister and dead mother? That is beyond terrible! Jake had nothing more to say to me and walked out to follow after his girlfriend.\n\nI didn't get anyone else involved in the situation. But Jake did. He tried getting support from friends and family. But he got the exact opposite reaction he'd hoped for. They were all mad at him over what he'd done. I got many phone calls and message from people offering me condolences and saying they were not on Jake's side. I tried to do damage control. But now everybody knows. It's been a week now, and Jake's refused to speak to me. I've sent him detailed pictures of the ring, just in case he wanted a jeweler to replicate it. But making a copy would be very expensive unless he used fake stones. And thus far there has been no response. I don't know what the situation is with his girlfriend. If she even still is his girlfriend after what happened. But I still stand by the fact that Jake had to return the ring. I have since had all my wife's jewelry placed in a safety deposit box that only I have access to. And the jewelry will remain there until my daughter is 21. And may even stay there if she wants to keep it safe that way.\n\nI know I'm in the right to have reclaimed the ring. However I don't want my son to hate me. And I don't want the family to hate him. If anyone has any advice as to how to better mediate this situation without me giving away the ring or spending a lot of money, I'm all ears. \n\nEdit: Fixed a slight name mix-up.

We became close to the point that we\u2019re flatmates this year bc our mutual friend offered rooms in a flat but sometimes she would overstep my boundaries..\n\nOne time after I had only just met her, she called me at 3am bc she had gone out and she didnt know where she was altho she was obviously with her friend and a few other people (which i had seen on some peoples snapchat stories including hers), I was scared going out that late at night to look for her but I eventually found her and she was drunk, I brought her to her room, fed her, gave her water and tucked her in but she followed me to mine and said she couldnt sleep alone and I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing my room/bed with her. I don\u2019t like other peoples touch besides my immediate family (not due to anything, it\u2019s just how I\u2019ve always been) and I also really dont like alcohol, even when my family consumes it, so I felt really uncomfortable with her there.\n*********TW: self harm/scars*******\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI said no a few times and tried to turn her around but then she rolled up her sleeve and showed me her wrists and arms which had you-know-what and made me feel guilty which led me into letting her stay the night, I made sure I went on the other end of the bed as far away from her but she kept coming close and trying to hold my hand and hug me even after I tried to stop her. I ended up just laying there bc she wouldnt stop and I didn\u2019t sleep the whole night because I felt sick and uncomfortable. I get that shes a person who likes physical touch but I told her I didnt like it and she ignored me.\n\nAfter that night I was thinking of avoiding her because she remembered everything and there was no legit excuse for what she did but I felt bad because I\u2019m a naturally nice person and she only had 1 other friend so I continued to talk to her and keep her company but when I would be in my room she\u2019d barge in and when I told her to leave while I got changed she refused to and instead said she\u2019d look away or she\u2019d throw a blanket over her head but I didnt like that. \n\nShe told me she was pansexual but she identifies more as gay which I was completely fine with until she continued trying to touch me and make me uncomfortable even when I blatantly told her I didn\u2019t like touching or being near people often. I told her I was positively sure that I was heterosexual after a long time of thinking I was asexual but she always says that I\u2019m gay whenever I compliment a girl on her looks, but it\u2019s literally just a compliment and she doesnt get that and continues to insist that I\u2019m \u201cprobably gay\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m already quite naturally irritable although I really push it down when I\u2019m with \u201cfriends\u201d which is why I usually give them a heads up before I isolate myself (because I like to be alone, it helps me think) but when I tell her she persists on coming in my room even tho I get visibly upset at being disturbed. One time she also slapped my butt which made me walk out and lock myself in my room and cry and  hyperventilate myself to sleep. She tries to hold my hand and touch me but I really really dont like physical touch unless its like an occasional hug from a long time friend or a formal handshake with a senior. \n\nI don\u2019t like assuming things but I think she has a thing for me because I was talking to her cousins girlfriend who said this guy was interested in me (which I already didnt like the sound of) but he didnt want to make a move bc my friend had put a \u201cclaim\u201d on me which honestly scared me. I\u2019ve told her that I am not gay, I don\u2019t like girls, I dont even really like boys but she PERSISTS that I like girls. It\u2019s frustrating.. feels like when you try to tell your parents the truth but they dont believe you and think you\u2019re lying.\n\nPlease help me. I want to properly sit down and express how I feel to her but I\u2019ve tried that before and she doesn\u2019t listen. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m completely put off from our friendship and its made me so uncomfortable that everything she does or says makes me uneasy.

So she moved in with her dad, who WILL NOT allow any cats to live with him. She then asked if Ferguson (the cat) could stay with me, and I happily said yes of course.... that was 2 1/2 years ago. Now I\u2019ve grown to absolutely love and cherish this cat completely as my own. We sleep together every night & I have separation anxiety if I\u2019m away from him for too long. My friend hardly comes to visit him (it\u2019s been about 3 months since she has), never cleans his litter, or buys his food, pays for vet bills etc... \nThis is a really good friend I have, one of my only & I would consider her a sister. That being said, she is now moving back in with her mom & I am moving a town 40 mins away; I have a feeling she will ask for Fergy back soon & I just have no idea what to do with it. \nAny advice?", "completion": "This happened to my former housemate from college once. He agreed to babysit a cat and *five years* went by. Cute little black cat named Midnight, not a spot of white on him. Former Housemate paid for everything. Nothing was too good for Midnight, and the little guy became his baby. He had the tower, the built-in wall shelves, the automatic box, the robotic laser, the microchip, he went to the vet twice a year whether he needed it or not and often when he did, because Midnight had a health condition he was born with, the poor lovey. Former Housemate loved this cat to pieces.\n\nThen his friend returned with a carrier, expecting to get her cat back. After radio silence for four and three quarter years.\n\nI wouldn't say I heard his heart break, but it felt that way. He didn't say anything, just kind of stood there.\n\nThen my other former housemate, whom I had just married at the time, turned to Former Housemate and said \"Buddy, I think it's time you tell her the truth.\"\n\n\"Really? But-\"\n\n\"Midnight the First didn't make it, sweetheart. I am so sorry. [Former Housemate] did all he could for him, paid for everything at [Vet]'s office, but in the end, we had to put the little guy to sleep. You were away and we didn't know what you'd think, and [Former Housemate] just couldn't get over it, he missed the poor little guy so much, me and [Me] went and found another little cat at the county SPCA, looked as close as we could get to Midnight the First. Twoie, come here, boyo.\" And he made the treat sound, and Midnight obligingly came running.\n\nThe friend looked him over, sighed and remarked that she saw it now. Midnight II *did* look different up close. *Her* Midnight was smaller, had blue eyes, not gold, and his tail used to point more. Why, she couldn't take [Former Housemate's] cat. Twoie didn't even know her. She called him and called, and he just ignored her. So it was obvious that he was not her cat.\n\nSo we went out and had a beautiful wake for Midnight the First at the bar, paid for her drinks, and that was that.\n\nThe fact that all kittens' tails stop pointing, their eyes almost always change from blue and cats who have been cue-trained only come when called if given their cue...yeah, never seemed to occur to her. She'd just gotten a kitten, then gone on study abroad, then taught abroad, then taken some time to get back and not really learned all that much about Cat Facts. (I understand she came from dog people, so best not to hold it against her.)\n\nBut our former housemate? I reckon he'd hide a body, steal an election or go beat up God if my husband ever needed a favor, for saving his cat and his friendship for him. Also, Midnight started answering to Twoie sometimes and is fully seventeen years old these days, though only his human and vet know that. Socially, he admits to sixteen, for obvious reasons. Lovely little fellow, still small and black.\n\nIt's never a good idea to lie, but in a case where a person kind of remembers they have a cat and is sort of lowkey dreading the resumption of responsibility, while the other person dearly loves the cat and is dreading the fight to keep them, a third party providing a face-saving falsehood that lets both parties be satisfied with everyone's honor intact, effectively taking the blame for any hurt feelings onto their own karma, that can be one good fix.\n\nBut you'd need a hell of a fast-thinking friend, or a very common-looking cat."}

Devon rubbed me the wrong way instantly, he's a college football player of like 6'4 with blonde hair (Just imagine a stereotypical rich douche bag who plays football in school). When we first met he was trying to charm me the best he could with a disgustingly superficial mask. When I first went to dinner with his family and my daughter there were multiple red flags I spotted instantly when paying attention to their relationship dynamic. When Devon's parents asked her questions Devon would motion her to stop talking and then talk over her, he'd constantly tell my daughter what to do and when, he seemed super controlling. I did a background check on him and what do you know, he had a DUI from like 8 months ago when he had first turned 18.\n\nI had also noticed little things as well, such as one time I watched him drop my daughter off and he didn't know I was watching, and he was speeding at like 40 in a residential before dropping her off and peeling out like a douche. I really just don't like this kid and he seems EXACTLY like my ex wife who was a fucking psychotic bitch who made my life hell every day. Thing is, I can't really do dick about it. I'm not a prude, I make super explicit disturbing music for a living and have had a criminal past before so I ABSOLUTELY do not believe in trying to control or forcefully direct an almost adult into doing what I think is right for them. If I tell her she can't be with him, she'll just blow me off and move in with him, what am I going to restrain my daughter from leaving the house??\n\nI'm really scared for my daughter and if this fucking piece of shit gets her pregnant I will be immensely sad at the pain everyone will face in the future.

My brother makes a stupid amount of money with his job, thus his wife makes it known that they are wealthy and walks with her nose in the air and acts like she is above me and my other siblings. She has always been mean to me, and even told my brother that if we wanted to hang out, it would have to be at my parents house because I would dirty their house, because I am 5 years old, after all.

She excused herself a few times and fed my nephew. During family gatherings, I always close my bedroom door, usually because it\u2019s really dirty and I don\u2019t want it to be an eye sore when people walk by it to use the bathroom. \n\nMy sister had gotten me a poster from her work for my birthday, and I went to go put it in my room, and when I opened the door my sister in law was sitting on MY chair in MY room, breast feeding my nephew. She literally screamed as if I had brought 3 of my friends to watch her. A, it was an accident and I had no intention of trying to watch her take out her boobs. B, she was in my room, I don\u2019t think I have to knock before I enter MY room. My brother came to her rescue and she started screaming that I was a pervert and that I was probably waiting for the right moment to walk in on her. My brother asked me what my problem was and I said that I had no idea she was in there and that she was supposed to be in his room. She then said that my recliner was more comfortable for her to sit in. She then kept calling me a pervert and disgusting, so after arguing with them and pleading my case she and my brother left. Now I feel like she\u2019s gonna be telling people that I did it on purpose, and she will probably spin it and say that I tried to take pictures or something. I have a girlfriend that I see naked so I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with her anyway. Not sure what I should do. I still have to see her for the remainder of the holidays, and even though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, it\u2019s really bothering me. \n\nTLDR: my sister in law was breastfeeding in my bedroom without my knowledge, so I accidentally walked in on her with her boobs out, and she proceeded to scream at me and call me a pervert\n\n\nUpdate: I wanna say thanks for the advice. There\u2019s been a lot of comments and I can\u2019t read and reply to each one individually. I know there\u2019s a better way to post updates but I don\u2019t have the time or energy to do that. So here\u2019s an update since last night. My mom told me she talked to my sister in law, and told her she didn\u2019t appreciate that outburst in our house. That I had every right to go into my bedroom and that she should have asked before going in there. According to my mom, she responded semi-well to that and she said she may have overreacted. That may have been my mom trying to get me to be less anxious about it, but I will try to take her word for it. My brother and I are meeting up this weekend and I\u2019m gonna help him move stuff out of his basement so that\u2019ll be the perfect time to hash things out. She will be gone, so she can\u2019t interfere. A lot of comments dragged my brother, and yes, he was the asshole who could have defused things by defending me and telling her to calm down. I told him I would only help him and talk to him if he promises not to be an ass and let me tell my side. Also a lot of people said this was fake?? I know throwaway accounts are usually trolling but i swear this is not fake!! I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to be put in this awkward and anxious situation, especially with family and I don\u2019t know who would lie about something like this??Another thing, people want to know what my girlfriend thought, she was upset and angry just like me. She said that it wasn\u2019t fair how she treated me and that it makes her disappointed in my brothers lack of understanding. So that\u2019s how things are now. Hopefully my brother listens to what I have to say. He knows me better than anyone and he knows I would never do anything to deliberately make his family uncomfortable.", "completion": "This is ridiculous, if anyone is to blame its her for sexualizing her OWN breastfeeding. \n\nShe is just inventing a reason to get outraged."}
{"prompt": "My sister plays Minecraft on my PC, since I\u2019m in college and I left my desktop at the house. I came back from school just this weekend, and was using my computer, when I found the \u201cdiscord\u201d chat app. Originally, I didn\u2019t think much of it, and assumed it was for her to talk to her friends when she plays.\n\nI looked through her chats, and found a person she has been talking to since May 15th, called \u201cchatline.\u201d As I scrolled up I found out that she was sending nude pictures, and videos, to this guy who seems to be around the age of 17 (I found his Instagram).\n\nHe says thing like \u201cI\u2019m going to cut myself if you don\u2019t reply to me,\u201d and sends gifs of sexual positions he wants to try with my sister. I could hardly even look at what I was reading.\n\nIt appears as though they are dating online. I am completely shocked and can\u2019t believe that this is happening. My sister has been manipulated and exposed to things she just shouldn\u2019t be around at 12 years old.\n\nI\u2019m really stuck and don\u2019t know what to do. On the one hand I could tell my parents, but I don\u2019t want to ruin the relationship between my sister and them, or I could talk to her directly. I want to report this guy she\u2019s talking to as a child predator, but I don\u2019t know what is best to do.", "completion": "The **BEST** case here is that the person she's talking to is \"just\" a pedophile.\n\nConsider the weight of that statement for a moment.\n\nThe alternative explanation is that this person is engaging in typical grooming behavior. Trying to acclimate children into sexual behavior and building dependence, using the relationship to gather images that are sold in child pornography black markets, and ultimately leveraging that to cause them to \"visit\" the groomer (which can result in kidnapping, rape, and/or sex trafficking).\n\nDo not ignore this."}
{"prompt": "A week ago he (40m) picked me (15f) up from school and then started to stare at me but at my chest, i told him to focus on the road and he did until he pulled over and put his hand on my thigh and started to go up to my crotch, I got really frightened then he stopped and went back home like nothing happened. I stayed in my room the whole day after that and felt scared whenever i was around him, he later came to me and apologized and said if i ever told anyone it would be my fault if he got in trouble, so i kept shut about it. Then the day after that he did it again but put his hand my t shirt and touched my boobs saying he was giving me a massage, I tried to get away from him and show discomfort but he wouldn\u2019t let go, i was shaking after that. I don\u2019t know what to do because everyone sees him as a good man and wouldn\u2019t believe me", "completion": "I\u2019m so sorry. Do you have a mother? Do you think she would help?\n\nIf you think your mother would react harshly, I would tell a teacher asap.\n\nThis is not your fault. Your father is disgusting and horrible."}
{"prompt": " I've known him for a long time, he's become increasingly unstable over the past year. He thinks \"the jews\" are spying on him and listening to his conversations through his phone. He's smart, but fucking crazy. He told me he wants to do this and he's flying to new york and has bought his plane ticket. He's told me he wants to die young and be remembered. He's friends with neo nazis and he hasn't taken his anti-psychotics in months. Please help.", "completion": "Police. Immediately. \nI would alert the police nearby, so they can arrest him, as well as the police near the synagogue in question.\nPlease please do this RIGHT NOW. Reddit is not the place for questions like this - law enforcement needs to be involved ASAP. You could end up saving dozens or hundreds of lives - and if you DON'T contact law enforcement, you would be partially responsible for those deaths. \nI'm Jewish, but would say the same regardless of who he wanted to kill/harm. So many mass shootings could be prevented by someone like you taking action. If you're afraid to handle this on your own, please at least provide us with some information so someone can tip off the police. This is terrifying."}
{"prompt": "A few nights ago I was working late at a restaurant where I live. I had to close the store and I didn\u2019t get home until 11:00PM. Myself and my boyfriend started watching TV when I got home and I started to get ready for bed. I just finished brushing my teeth when my phone read 12:14AM and I was receiving a call from my father who lives 3 hours away from me. I initially knew it was strange for him to be calling me that hour. \n\nWhen I picked up the phone my father was severely crying. I\u2019ve never heard him cry before so I found this very strange. I felt my heart sink to my feet. I could tell he was very intoxicated as well. He was telling me that his wife of 12 years (my step-mother) had left the house earlier that day due to an argument they had. Then he started talking about how she has been cheating on him for awhile. I had no idea this was happening and I was very shocked. He began to bring up his will to me and said if anything happens to him to please not forget him. He said Father\u2019s Day is soon coming and he didn\u2019t want me to forget him. \n\nHe then started to cry more severely. He was crying so hard that I could barely understand what he was saying. I told him to repeat what he said which was \u201cI\u2019m in the garage with the rifle. I\u2019m going to blow my brains out now. I wanted to call and hear your voice for one last time.\u201d My boyfriend jumped out of bed and went into the other room and started speaking to the police where my father lives. \n\nWhile I was waiting for the police to arrive I had to stall my father from shooting himself. I brought up anything I could think of. My faucet in my kitchen is leaky so I asked if he could come fix it. I ended up having to stall him for 1 hour and 20 minutes before the police showed up. He did live. I stalled him long enough for the police to take him to the hospital. The police seized the firearm and told me when they went into the garage he had a bed made out of towels and clothes. They said this must have been planned. They also said the rifle was fully loaded. My father had also drank a 26oz of whiskey, half a flask of whiskey, and a tallboy of beer.\n\nHe has been admitted for 72 hours as that is protocol. He got released yesterday and I\u2019ve never felt so worried in my entire life. My step-mother has not showed any concern as she only picked him up from the hospital to bring him home. She did not stay at the house with him last night and it was his first night home. \n\nEveryone has been telling me that I saved his life. I honestly feel like I haven\u2019t done anything. I can\u2019t see any good In this situation. I\u2019m terrified.  I cannot travel to where he lives because I have a job where I am. I would not be able to pay my rent. I offered to go get him and bring him to my city. He has friends where I live and I believe it would be good for him. He refused and said he doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere because he needs to fix his car. He also said he needs to figure out what he is going to do with his house. I want to be with him but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m so scared. I don\u2019t know how I will ever stop worrying about this.", "completion": "Tell your dad how much you love him and find a day to visit him.\n\nTell him you understand his problems even if you dont.\n\nHe feels all alone in this painful world and when he was about to leave it, he called you. I think that says a lot about what you should think."}
{"prompt": "My \u201cbest friend\u201d (i don\u2019t really want to call her that anymore) told me that she raped her ex boyfriend. I didn\u2019t ask or anything. I got to school, met her, and the first thing she said was \u201cI went home to him yesterday and forced him to do it\u201d. \n\nI was under the impression that she had gotten over him, or that she was at least trying to. He was really uncomfortable in the end of their relationship so he broke it off and said he didn\u2019t want any contact with her. During the aftermath of their relationship ending she was constantly crossing boundaries, but she hadn\u2019t done it in a while. So she has a history of doing too much and making people uncomfortable. \n\nAt first I didn\u2019t really know how to react. She said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m so stupid\u201d and I agreed with her. Then she started saying things like \u201cCan you just tell me this is a dream\u201d \u201cI mean people who have been abused can turn into the abuser\u201d \u201cI was manic or something it wasn\u2019t really me\u201d etc. and I told her that she\u2019s just trying to make excuses and that she has to face the consequences. Then she started talking about future jobs, so I told her that she was being selfish. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t really say anything else. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019ve always thought that I would stop being friends with someone if something like that was ever revealed, but now I don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019m in the same class as her (we graduate this summer) and we are in the same friend group. So I don\u2019t know what i\u2019m supposed to do. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, their genders don\u2019t have anything to do with the situation. I am having a hard time because this was a person I thought I could trust and that I thought could never harm another person in this way. Having a (now former) friend admit to raping someone isn\u2019t exactly easy to process. That is why I needed advice. I would still need advice if it was a guy I was really close to that raped a girl.\n\nEdit2: I got the ex\u2019s snap, i\u2019ll be speaking to him and doing my best to support him in whatever decision he chooses. I am also doing my best to distance myself from the girl. Also something fucked up I learnt today, the girl told her guardian about what she did and her guardian simply said \u201cit\u2019s not that important. just ignore what you did and focus on school\u201d.", "completion": "Reach out to him to clarify the situation and if it's as bad as it sounds and see if you can talk to law enforcement together.  It'll be an uphill battle if he wants to seek legal action; he's almost certainly not going to be taken seriously so any evidence you can offer will help."}
